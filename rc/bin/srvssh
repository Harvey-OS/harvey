# Serve Unix u9fs over SSH
#
# Basically, try each of the following until you find one that works:
#
#	srvssh unix
#	srvssh -r unix
#	srvssh -R unix
#	srvssh -r -s unix
#	srvssh -R -s unix
#
# and then never look back.  Note that "srvssh unix" should always
# work.  It's just that if you're talking with certain sshd's, you'll get
# hit by Nagle's algorithm and need to explore the other flags.

# When using ssh to start u9fs, the only way to turn off
# Nagle's algorithm (which kills the performance of RPC-based
# protocols like 9P) is to allocate a pseudo-terminal.  The
# command ssh -Rmp attempts to allocate a pseudo-terminal and
# then put it in a transparent mode.  Especially when
# connected to older SSH daemons, the connection ends up not
# quite transparent.  To get around this, we explicity set the tty
# mode on the command line as well.  The hope is that -Rmp makes
# the connection transparent enough for the Tversion, and the stty
# command will do the rest.  If -Rmp doesn't make the connection
# transparent enough for the Tversion (but the stty commands do 
# make the connection fully transparent) then add "-s 5" to the srv
# command to tell it to wait 5 seconds before sending the Tversion.
# That should be enough time for the stty to take effect.
