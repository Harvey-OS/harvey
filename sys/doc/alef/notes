Implementation Notes

1. The compiler does not support long and ulong - wait for the R4000

2. Processes created by par cannot use the blocking synchronisation operators:

	Rendez.sleep
	Qlock.lock

3. Stack bounds checking is not implemented. Set ALEFstack to the amount of memory
   required by each task or process. ALEFstack can be changed any time. It should
   be declared as:

	extern int ALEFstack;

   doprint has a 1k automatic array so you probably don't want to set it less than
   2k.

4. The libraries, and in particular libA, only include routines I have had need of.

The directory /sys/src/alef/test/Y contains a large example program.
Y is a window system that uses only synchronous message passing to
implement many clients sharing the same address space.

Bugs

   These will be fixed soon.

1. If you do an exec from a proc the stack is not deallocated.

2. Only recieving expressions work correctly in alt statements.

Recent fixes

1. -D & -I options added for preprocessor
2. -D# option changed to -d#
3. pointer - int type expressions fixed
4. floating point fixed
