<H4>Introduction
</H4>
<P>
Acid is a general purpose, source level symbolic debugger.
The debugger is built around a simple command language. 
The command language, distinct from the language of the program being debugged,
provides a flexible user interface that allows the debugger
interface to be customized for a specific application or architecture.
Moreover, it provides an opportunity to write test and
verification code independently of a program's source code.
Acid is able to debug multiple
processes provided they share a common set of symbols, such as the processes in
a threaded program.
</P>
<P>
Like other language-based solutions, Acid presents a poor user interface but
provides a powerful debugging tool.
Application of Acid to hard problems is best approached by writing functions off-line
(perhaps loading them with the
<TT>include</TT>
function or using the support provided by
<A href="/magic/man2html/1/acme"><I>acme</I>(1)),
</A>rather than by trying to type intricate Acid operations
at the interactive prompt.
</P>
<P>
Acid allows the execution of a program to be controlled by operating on its
state while it is stopped and by monitoring and controlling its execution
when it is running. Each program action that causes a change 
of execution state is reflected by the execution
of an Acid function, which may be user defined.
A library of default functions provides the functionality of a normal debugger.
</P>
<P>
A Plan 9 process is controlled by writing messages to a control file in the
<A href="/magic/man2html/3/proc"><I>proc</I>(3)
</A>file system. Each control message has a corresponding Acid function, which
sends the message to the process. These functions take a process id
(<I>pid</I>)
as an
argument. The memory and text file of the program may be manipulated using
the indirection operators. The symbol table, including source cross reference,
is available to an Acid program. The combination allows complex operations
to be performed both in terms of control flow and data manipulation.
</P>
<H4>Input format and <TT>whatis</TT>
</H4>
<P>
Comments start with
<TT>//</TT>
and continue to the end of the line.
Input is a series of statements and expressions separated by semicolons.
At the top level of the interpreter, the builtin function
<TT>print</TT>
is called automatically to display the result of all expressions except function calls.
A unary
<TT>+</TT>
may be used as a shorthand to force the result of a function call to be printed.
</P>
<P>
Also at the top level, newlines are treated as semicolons
by the parser, so semicolons are unnecessary when evaluating expressions.
</P>
<P>
When Acid starts, it loads the default program modules,
enters interactive mode, and prints a prompt. In this state Acid accepts
either function definitions or statements to be evaluated.
In this interactive mode
statements are evaluated immediately, while function definitions are
stored for later invocation.
</P>
<P>
The
<TT>whatis</TT>
operator can be used to report the state of identifiers known to the interpreter.
With no argument,
<TT>whatis</TT>
reports the name of all defined Acid functions; when supplied with an identifier
as an argument it reports any variable, function, or type definition
associated with the identifier.
Because of the way the interpreter handles semicolons,
the result of a
<TT>whatis</TT>
statement can be returned directly to Acid without adding semicolons.
A syntax error or interrupt returns Acid to the normal evaluation
mode; any partially evaluated definitions are lost.
</P>
<H4>Using the Library Functions
</H4>
<P>
After loading the program binary, Acid loads the portable and architecture-specific
library functions  that form the standard debugging environment.
These files are Acid source code and are human-readable.
The following example uses the standard debugging library to show how
language and program interact:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% acid /bin/ls
/bin/ls:mips plan 9 executable

/sys/lib/acid/port
/sys/lib/acid/mips
acid: new()
75721: system call  _main ADD  $-0x14,R29
75721: breakpoint   main+0x4   MOVW  R31,0x0(R29)
acid: bpset(ls)
acid: cont()
75721: breakpoint   ls    ADD  $-0x16c8,R29
acid: stk()
At pc:0x0000141c:ls /sys/src/cmd/ls.c:87
ls(s=0x0000004d,multi=0x00000000) /sys/src/cmd/ls.c:87
    called from main+0xf4 /sys/src/cmd/ls.c:79
main(argc=0x00000000,argv=0x7ffffff0) /sys/src/cmd/ls.c:48
    called from _main+0x20 /sys/src/libc/mips/main9.s:10
acid: PC
0xc0000f60
acid: *PC
0x0000141c
acid: ls
0x0000141c
</PRE></TT></DL>
The function
<TT>new()</TT>
creates a new process and stops it at the first instruction.
This change in state is reported by a call to the
Acid function
<TT>stopped</TT>,
which is called by the interpreter whenever the debugged program stops.
<TT>Stopped</TT>
prints the status line giving the pid, the reason the program stopped
and the address and instruction at the current PC.
The function
<TT>bpset</TT>
makes an entry in the breakpoint table and plants a breakpoint in memory.
The
<TT>cont</TT>
function continues the process, allowing it to run until some condition
causes it to stop. In this case the program hits the breakpoint placed on
the function
<TT>ls</TT>
in the C program. Once again the
<TT>stopped</TT>
routine is called to print the status of the program. The function
<TT>stk</TT>
prints a C stack trace of the current process. It is implemented using
a builtin Acid function that returns the stack trace as a list; the code
that formats the information is all written in Acid. 
The Acid variable
<TT>PC</TT>
holds the address of the 
cell where the current value of the processor register
<TT>PC</TT>
is stored. By indirecting through
the value of
<TT>PC</TT>
the address where the program is stopped can be found.
All of the processor registers are available by the same mechanism.
</P>
<H4>Types
</H4>
<P>
An Acid variable has one of four types:
<I>integer</I>,
<I>float</I>,
<I>list</I>,
or
<I>string</I>.
The type of a variable is inferred from the type of the right-hand
side of the assignment expression which last set its value.
Referencing a variable that has not yet
been assigned draws a "used but not set" error. Many of the operators may
be applied to more than
one type; for these operators the action of the operator is determined by
the types of its operands. The action of each operator is defined in the
<I>Expressions</I>
section of this manual.
</P>
<H4>Variables
</H4>
<P>
Acid has three kinds of variables: variables defined by the symbol table
of the debugged program, variables that are defined and maintained
by the interpreter as the debugged program changes state, and variables
defined and used by Acid programs.
</P>
<P>
Some examples of variables maintained by the interpreter are the register
pointers listed by name in the Acid list variable
<TT>registers</TT>,
and the symbol table listed by name and contents in the Acid variable
<TT>symbols</TT>.
</P>
<P>
The variable
<TT>pid</TT>
is updated by the interpreter to select the most recently created process
or the process selected by the
<TT>setproc</TT>
builtin function.
</P>
<H4>Formats
</H4>
<P>
In addition to a type, variables have formats. The format is a code
letter that determines the printing style and the effect of some of the
operators on that variable. The format codes are derived from the format
letters used by
<A href="/magic/man2html/1/db"><I>db</I>(1).
</A>By default, symbol table variables and numeric constants
are assigned the format code
<TT>X</TT>,
which specifies 32-bit hexadecimal.
Printing a variable with this code yields the output
<TT>0x00123456</TT>.
The format code of a variable may be changed from the default by using the 
builtin function
<TT>fmt</TT>.
This function takes two arguments, an expression and a format code. After
the expression is evaluated the new format code is attached to the result
and forms the return value from
<TT>fmt</TT>.
The backslash operator is a short form of
<TT>fmt</TT>.
The format supplied by the backslash operator must be the format character
rather than an expression.
If the result is assigned to a variable the new format code is maintained
in the variable. For example:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
acid: x=10
acid: print(x)
0x0000000a 
acid: x = fmt(x, 'D')
acid: print(x, fmt(x, 'X'))
10 0x0000000a
acid: x
10
acid: x\o
12
</PRE></TT></DL>

Print the value in symbolic form.
</DL>
</dl>
<H4>Complex types
</H4>
<P>
Acid permits the definition of the layout of memory.
The usual method is to use the
<TT>-a</TT>
flag of the compilers to produce Acid-language descriptions of data structures (see
<A href="/magic/man2html/1/2c"><I>2c</I>(1))
</A>although such definitions can be typed interactively.
The keywords
<TT>complex</TT>,
<TT>adt</TT>,
<TT>aggr</TT>,
and
<TT>union</TT>
are all equivalent; the compiler uses the synonyms to document the declarations.
A complex type is described as a set of members, each containing a format letter,
an offset in the structure, and a name.  For example, the C structure
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
struct List {
	int         type;
	struct List *next;
};
</PRE></TT></DL>
is described by the Acid statement
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
complex List {
	'D'	0	type;
	'X'	4	next;
};
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<H4>Scope
</H4>
<P>
Variables are global unless they are either parameters to functions
or are declared as
<TT>local</TT>
in a function body. Parameters and local variables are available only in
the body of the function in which they are instantiated.
Variables are dynamically bound: if a function declares a local variable
with the same name as a global variable, the global variable will be hidden
whenever the function is executing.
For example, if a function
<TT>f</TT>
has a local called
<TT>main</TT>,
any function called below
<TT>f</TT>
will see the local version of
<TT>main</TT>,
not the external symbol.
</P>
<H4>Addressing
</H4>
<P>
Since the symbol table specifies addresses,
to access the value of program variables
an extra level of indirection
is required relative to the source code.
For consistency, the registers are maintained as pointers as well; Acid variables with the names
of processor registers point to cells holding the saved registers.
</P>
<P>
The location in a file or memory image associated with
an address is calculated from a map
associated with the file.
Each map contains one or more quadruples (<I>t</I>,
<I>b</I>,
<I>e</I>,
<I>f</I>),
defining a segment named
<I>t</I>
(usually 
<TT>text</TT>,
<TT>data</TT>,
<TT>regs</TT>,
or
<TT>fpregs</TT>)
mapping addresses in the range
<I>b</I>
through
<I>e</I>
to the part of the file
beginning at
offset
<I>f</I>.
The memory model of a Plan 9 process assumes
that segments are disjoint.  There
can be more than one segment of a given type (e.g., a process
may have more than one text segment) but segments
may not overlap.
An address
<I>a</I>
is translated
to a file address
by finding a segment
for which
<I>b</I>
+
<I>a</I>
&lt;
<I>e</I>;
the location in the file
is then
<I>address</I>
+
<I>f</I>
-
<I>b</I>.
</P>
<P>
Usually,
the text and initialized data of a program
are mapped by segments called 
<TT>text</TT>
and
<TT>data</TT>.
Since a program file does not contain bss, stack, or register data,
these data are
not mapped by the data segment.
The text segment is mapped similarly in the memory image of
a normal (i.e., non-kernel) process.
However, the segment called 
<TT>*data</TT>
maps memory from the beginning to the end of the program's data space.
This region contains the program's static data, the bss, the
heap and the stack.  A segment
called
<TT>*regs</TT>
maps the registers;
<TT>*fpregs</TT>
maps the floating point registers.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it is useful to define a map with a single segment
mapping the region from 0 to 0xFFFFFFFF; such a map
allows the entire file to be examined
without address translation.  The builtin function
<TT>map</TT>
examines and modifies Acid's map for a process.
</P>
<H4>Name Conflicts
</H4>
<P>
Name conflicts between keywords in the Acid language, symbols in the program,
and previously defined functions are resolved when the interpreter starts up.
Each name is made unique by prefixing enough
<TT>$</TT>
characters to the front of the name to make it unique. Acid reports
a list of each name change at startup. The report looks like this:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
/bin/sam: mips plan 9 executable
/lib/acid/port
/lib/acid/mips
Symbol renames:
	append=$append T/0xa4e40
acid:
</PRE></TT></DL>
The symbol
<TT>append</TT>
is both a keyword and a text symbol in the program. The message reports
that the text symbol is now named
<TT>$append</TT>.
</P>
<H4>Expressions
</H4>
<P>
Operators have the same
binding and precedence as in C.
For operators of equal precedence, expressions are evaluated from left to right. 
</P>
<H4>Boolean expressions
</H4>
<P>
If an expression is evaluated for a boolean condition the test
performed depends on the type of the result. If the result is of
<I>integer</I>
or
<I>floating</I>
type the result is true if the value is non-zero. If the expression is a
<I>list</I>
the result is true if there are any members in the list.
If the expression is a
<I>string</I>
the result is true if there are any characters in the string.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	primary-expression:
		identifier
		identifier <TT>:</TT> identifier
		constant
		<TT>(</TT> expression <TT>)</TT>
		<TT>{</TT> elist <TT>}</TT>

	elist:
		expression
		elist , expression
</PRE></TT></DL>
An identifier may be any legal Acid variable. The colon operator returns the
address of parameters or local variables in the current stack of a program.
For example:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
*main:argc
</PRE></TT></DL>
prints the number of arguments passed into main. Local variables and parameters
can only be referenced after the frame has been established. It may be necessary to
step a program over the first few instructions of a breakpointed function to properly set
the frame.
</P>
<P>
Constants follow the same lexical rules as C.
A list of expressions delimited by braces forms a list constructor.
A new list is produced by evaluating each expression when the constructor is executed.
The empty list is formed from
<TT>{}</TT>.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
acid: x = 10
acid: l = { 1, x, 2\D }
acid: x = 20
acid: l
{0x00000001 , 0x0000000a , 2 }
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<H4>Lists
</H4>
<P>
Several operators manipulate lists.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	list-expression:
		primary-expression
		<TT>head</TT> primary-expression
		<TT>tail</TT> primary-expression
		<TT>append</TT> expression <TT>,</TT> primary-expression
		<TT>delete</TT> expression <TT>,</TT> primary-expression
</PRE></TT></DL>
The
<I>primary-expression</I>
for
<TT>head</TT>
and
<TT>tail</TT>
must yield a value of type
<I>list</I>.
If there are no elements in the list the value of
<TT>head</TT>
or
<TT>tail</TT>
will be the empty list. Otherwise
<TT>head</TT>
evaluates to the first element of the list and
<TT>tail</TT>
evaluates to the rest.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
acid: head {}
{}
acid: head {1, 2, 3, 4}
0x00000001 
acid: tail {1, 2, 3, 4}
{0x00000002 , 0x00000003 , 0x00000004 }
</PRE></TT></DL>
The first operand of
<TT>append</TT>
and
<TT>delete</TT>
must be an expression that yields a
<I>list</I>.
<TT>Append</TT>
places the result of evaluating
<I>primary-expression</I>
at the end of the list.
The
<I>primary-expression</I>
supplied to
<TT>delete</TT>
must evaluate to an integer;
<TT>delete</TT>
removes the 
<I>n</I>'th
item from the list, where
<I>n</I>
is integral value of
<I>primary-expression.</I>
List indices are zero-based.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	acid: append {1, 2}, 3
	{0x00000001 , 0x00000002 , 0x00000003 }
	acid: delete {1, 2, 3}, 1
	{0x00000001 , 0x00000003 }
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<P>
Assigning a list to a variable copies a reference to the list; if a list variable
is copied it still points at the same list.  To copy a list, the elements must
be copied piecewise using
<TT>head</TT>
and
<TT>append</TT>.
</P>
<H4>Operators
</H4>
<P>
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	postfix-expression:
		list-expression
		postfix-expression <TT>[</TT> expression <TT>]</TT>
		postfix-expression <TT>(</TT> argument-list <TT>)</TT>
		postfix-expression <TT>.</TT> tag
		postfix-expression <TT>-&gt;</TT> tag 
		postfix-expression <TT>++</TT>
		postfix-expression <TT>--</TT>

	argument-list:
		expression
		argument-list , expression
</PRE></TT></DL>
The
<TT>[</TT>
<I>expression</I>
<TT>]</TT>
operator performs indexing.
The indexing expression must result in an expression of
<I>integer</I>
type, say
<I>n</I>.
The operation depends on the type of
<I>postfix-expression</I>.
If the
<I>postfix-expression</I>
yields an
<I>integer</I>
it is assumed to be the base address of an array in the memory image.
The index offsets into this array; the size of the array members is
determined by the format associated with the
<I>postfix-expression</I>.
If the 
<I>postfix-expression</I>
yields a
<I>string</I>
the index operator fetches the
<I>n</I>'th
character
of the string. If the index points beyond the end
of the string, a zero is returned.
If the
<I>postfix-expression</I>
yields a
<I>list</I>
then the indexing operation returns the
<I>n</I>'th
item of the list.
If the list contains less than
<I>n</I>
items the empty list
<TT>{}</TT>
is returned.
</P>
<P>
The
<TT>++</TT>
and
<TT>--</TT>
operators increment and decrement integer variables.
The amount of increment or decrement depends on the format code. These postfix
operators return the value of the variable before the increment or decrement
has taken place.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	unary-expression:
		postfix-expression
		<TT>++</TT> unary-expression
		<TT>--</TT> unary-expression

	unary-operator: one of
		<TT>*</TT> <TT>@</TT> <TT>+</TT> <TT>-</TT> ~ <TT>!</TT>
</PRE></TT></DL>
The operators
<TT>*</TT>
and
<TT>@</TT>
are the indirection operators.
<TT>@</TT>
references a value from the text file of the program being debugged.
The size of the value depends on the format code. The
<TT>*</TT>
operator fetches a value from the memory image of a process. If either
operator appears on the left-hand side of an assignment statement, either the file
or memory will be written. The file can only be modified when Acid is invoked
with the
<TT>-w</TT>
option.
The prefix
<TT>++</TT>
and
<TT>--</TT>
operators perform the same operation as their postfix counterparts but
return the value after the increment or decrement has been performed. Since the
<TT>++</TT>
and
<TT>*</TT>
operators fetch and increment the correct amount for the specified format,
the following function prints correct machine instructions on a machine with
variable length instructions, such as the 68020 or 386:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	defn asm(addr)
	{
		addr = fmt(addr, 'i');
		loop 1, 10 do
			print(*addr++, "\n");
	}
</PRE></TT></DL>
The operators
<TT>~</TT>
and
<TT>!</TT>
perform bitwise and logical negation respectively. Their operands must be of
<I>integer</I>
type.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	cast-expression:
		unary-expression
		unary-expression <TT>\</TT> format-char
		<TT>(</TT> complex-name <TT>)</TT> unary-expression		
</PRE></TT></DL>
A unary expression may be preceded by a cast. The cast has the effect of
associating the value of 
<I>unary-expression</I>
with a complex type structure.
The result may then be dereferenced using the
<TT>.</TT>
and
<TT>-&gt;</TT>
operators.
</P>
<P>
An Acid variable may be associated with a complex type
to enable accessing the type's members:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
acid: complex List {
	'D'	0	type;
	'X'	4	next;
};
acid: complex List lhead
acid: lhead.type
10
acid: lhead = ((List)lhead).next
acid: lhead.type
-46
</PRE></TT></DL>
Note that the
<TT>next</TT>
field cannot be given a complex type automatically.
</P>
<P>
When entered at the top level of the interpreter,
an expression of complex type
is treated specially.
If the type is called
<TT>T</TT>
and an Acid function also called
<TT>T</TT>
exists,
then that function will be called with the expression as its argument.
The compiler options
<TT>-a</TT>
and
<TT>-aa</TT>
will generate Acid source code defining such complex types and functions; see
<A href="/magic/man2html/1/2c"><I>2c</I>(1).
</A></P>
<P>
A
<I>unary-expression</I>
may be qualified with a format specifier using the
<TT>o</TT>
perator. This has the same effect as passing the expression to the

Unlike in C,
<TT>+</TT>

do not scale the addition based on the format of the expression.
This means that

will always add 1 but
<TT>i++</TT>
will add the size corresponding to the format stored with
<TT>i</TT>.
If both operands are of either
<I>string</I>

Mixed integer and float compare on the integral value.  Other mixtures are always unequal.
Two lists are equal if they

<TT>return</TT>
terminates execution of the current function and returns to its caller.

The

is visible to called functions.
After a return from the current function the previous value of

<H4>Code variables

Acid permits the delayed evaluation of a parameter to a function.  The parameter
may then be evaluated at any time with the

operator.  Such parameters are called
<I>code variables</I>
and are defined by prefixing their name with an asterisk in their declaration.

For example, this function wraps up an expression for later evaluation:

<H4>Source Code Management

Acid provides the means to examine source code. Source code is
represented by lists of strings. Builtin functions provide mapping
from address to lines and vice-versa. The default debugging environment
has the means to load and display source files.
</P>
<H4>Builtin Functions
</H4>
<P>
The Acid interpreter has a number of builtin functions, which cannot be redefined.
These functions perform machine- or operating system-specific functions such as
symbol table and process management.
The following section presents a description of each builtin function.
The notation
<TT>{}</TT>
is used to denote the empty list, which is the default value of a function that
does not execute a
<TT>return</TT>
statement.
The type and number of parameters for each function are specified in the

The first element is an

of the program counter when the function was called. The third and fourth elements
contain lists of parameter and automatic variables respectively.

<TT>notestk</TT>
interprets its

argument as the address of a

structure passed by the kernel to a
<A href="/magic/man2html/2/notify"><I>notify</I>(2)
</A>function during note processing.
<TT>notestk</TT>
uses the
<TT>PC</TT>,
<TT>SP</TT>,
and link register from the
<TT>Ureg</TT>
to print a stack trace corresponding to the point in the program where the note
was received.
To get a valid stack trace on the MIPS and SPARC architectures from a notify
routine, the program must stop in a new function called from the notify routine
so that the link register is valid and the notify routine's parameters are
addressable.

<TT>stk</TT>
produces a short format stack trace. The stack trace includes each function
in the stack, where it was called from, and the value of the parameters.
The short format omits the values of automatic variables.
Parameters are assumed to be integer values in the format
<TT>X</TT>;
to print a parameter in the correct format use the
<TT>:</TT>
to obtain its address, apply the correct format, and use the
<TT>*</TT>
indirection operator to find its value.
It may be necessary to single step a couple of instructions into
a function to get a correct stack trace because the frame pointer adjustment
instruction may get scheduled down into the body of the function.
