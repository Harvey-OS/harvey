This paper describes the structure
and the operation of Plan 9 file servers.
The specifics apply to
our main Plan 9 file server

Introduction
.PP
The Plan 9 file server
Emelie
is the oldest piece of system software
still in use on Plan 9.
It evolved from a user-level program that served
serial lines on a Sequent multi-processor.
The current implementation is neither clean nor
portable,
but it has slowly come to terms with
its particular set of cranky computers
and devices.
