Cache/WORM Driver
.PP
The cache/WORM (cw) driver is by far the
largest and most complicated device driver in the file server.
There are four devices involved in the cw driver.
It implements a read/write pseudo-device (the cw-device)
and a read-only pseudo-device (the dump device)
by performing operations on its two constituent devices
the read-write c-device and the write-once-read-many
w-device.
The block numbers on the four devices are distinct,
although the
.I cw
addresses,
dump addresses,
and the
.I w
addresses are
highly correlated.
.PP
The cw-driver uses the w-device as the
stable storage of the file system at the time of the
last dump.
All newly written and a large number of recently used
exact copies of blocks of the w-device are kept on the c-device.
The c-device is much smaller than the w-device and
so the subset of w-blocks that are kept on the c-device are
mapped through a hash table kept on a partition of the c-device.
.PP
The map portion of the c-device consists of blocks of buckets of entries.
The declarations follow.
.Ex
	enum
	{
		BKPERBLK = 10,
		CEPERBK	= (BUFSIZE - BKPERBLK*sizeof(Off)) /
				(sizeof(Centry)*BKPERBLK),
	};
.Ee
.Ex
	typedef
	struct
	{
		ushort	age;
		short	state;
		Off	waddr;
	} Centry;
.Ee
.Ex
	typedef
	struct
	{
		long	agegen;
		Centry	entry[CEPERBK];
	} Bucket;
.Ee
.Ex
	Bucket	bucket[BKPERBLK];
.Ee
There is exactly one entry structure for each block in the
data partition of the c-device.
A bucket contains all of the w-addresses that have
the same hash code.
There are as many buckets as will fit
in a block and enough blocks to have the required
number of entries.
The entries in the bucket are maintained
in FIFO order with an age variable and an incrementing age generator.
When the age generator is about to overflow,
all of the ages in the bucket are rescaled
from zero.
.PP
The following steps go into converting a w-address into a c-address.
The bucket is found by
.Ex
	bucket_number = w-address % total_buckets;
	getbuf(c-device, bucket_offset + bucket_number/BKPERBLK);
.Ee
After the desired bucket is found,
the desired entry is found by a linear search within the bucket for the
entry with the desired
.CW waddr .
.PP
The state variable in the entry is
one of the following.
.Ex
	enum
	{
		Cnone	= 0,
		Cdirty,
		Cdump,
		Cread,
		Cwrite,
		Cdump1,
	};
.Ee
Every w-address has a state.
Blocks that are not in the
c-device have the implied
state
.CW Cnone .
The
.CW Cread
state is for blocks that have the
same data as the corresponding block in
the w-device.
Since the c-device is much faster than the
w-device,
.CW Cread
blocks are kept as long as possible and
used in preference to reading the w-device.
.CW Cread
blocks may be discarded from the c-device
when the space is needed for newer data.
The
.CW Cwrite
state is when the c-device contains newer data
than the corresponding block on the w-device.
This happens when a
.CW Cnone ,
.CW Cread ,
or
.CW Cwrite
block is written.
The
.CW Cdirty
state
is when the c-device contains
new data and the corresponding block
on the w-device has never been written.
This happens when a new block has been
allocated from the free space on the w-device.
.PP
The
.CW Cwrite
and
.CW Cdirty
blocks are created and never removed.
Unless something is done to
convert these blocks,
the c-device will gradually
fill up and stop functioning.
Once a day,
or by command,
a
.I dump
of the cw-device
is taken.
The purpose of
a dump is to queue the writes that
have been shunted to the c-device
to be written to the w-device.
Since the w-device is a WORM,
blocks cannot be rewritten.
Blocks that have already been written to the WORM must be
relocated to the unused portion of the w-device.
These are precisely the
blocks with
.CW Cwrite
state.
.PP
The dump algorithm is as follows:
.IP a)
The tree on the cw-device is walked
as long as the blocks visited have been
modified since the last dump.
These are the blocks with state
.CW Cwrite
and
.CW Cdirty .
It is possible to restrict the search
to within these blocks
since the directory containing a modified
file must have been accessed to modify the
file and accessing a directory will set its
modified time thus causing the block containing it
to be written.
The directory containing that directory must be
modified for the same reason.
The tree walk is thus drastically restrained and the
tree walk does not take much time.
.IP b)
All
.CW Cwrite
blocks found in the tree search
are relocated to new blank blocks on the w-device
and converted to
.CW Cdump
state.
All
.CW Cdirty
blocks are converted to
.CW Cdump
state without relocation.
At this point,
all modified blocks in the cw-device
have w-addresses that point to unwritten
WORM blocks.
These blocks are marked for later
writing to the w-device
with the state
.CW Cdump .
.IP c)
All open files that were pointing to modified
blocks are reopened to point at the corresponding
reallocated blocks.
This causes the directories leading to the
open files to be modified.
Thus the invariant discussed in a) is maintained.
.IP d)
The background dumping process will slowly
go through the map of the c-device and write out
all blocks with
.CW Cdump
state.
.PP
The dump takes a few minutes to walk the tree
and mark the blocks.
It can take hours to write the marked blocks
to the WORM.
If a marked block is rewritten before the old
copy has been written to the WORM,
it must be forced to the WORM before it is rewritten.
There is no problem if another dump is taken before the first one
is finished.
The newly marked blocks are just added to the marked blocks
left from the first dump.
.PP
If there is an error writing a marked block
to the WORM
then the
.CW dump
state is converted to
.CW Cdump1
and manual intervention is needed.
(See the
.CW cwcmd
.CW mvstate
command in
.I fs (8)).
These blocks can be disposed of by converting
their state back to
.CW Cdump
so that they will be written again.
They can also be converted to
.CW Cwrite
state so that they will be allocated new
addresses at the next dump.
In most other respects,
a
.CW Cdump1
block behaves like a
.CW Cwrite
block.
