Process Structure
.PP
The Plan 9 file system server is made from
an ancient version of the Plan 9 kernel.
The kernel contains process control,
synchronization,
locks,
and some memory
allocation.
The kernel has no user processes or
virtual memory.
.PP
The structure of the file system server
is a set of kernel processes
synchronizing mostly through message passing.
In Bootes there are 41 processes of 16 types:
