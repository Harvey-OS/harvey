#WELCOME TO THE PLAN 9 WIKI
#
#This collection of pages contains information pertinent to
#installing, configuring, and using the operating system [Plan 9 from
#Bell Labs | http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9].
#
#This is a [wiki], which means that anyone with a web browser or a
#Plan 9 installation can edit any of the pages (including this one).
#If you find a document you believe to be unclear or incomplete, edit
#that page to fix it. We use a simple [wiki syntax] rather than full
#HTML, which makes the editing much easier. If you're using a web
#browser, there is an Edit link at the bottom of the page. If you're
#using Acme, just edit the text and put the document back.
#
#There are also [Acme wiki instructions].
