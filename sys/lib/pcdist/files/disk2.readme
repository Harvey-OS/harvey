You have completed the Installation Process. If you want
to tune the device configuration saved in C:\PLAN9\PLAN9.INI
by the installation, save C:\PLAN9\PLAN9.INI to a safe place
in the DOS file system, reboot from Disk 1 and select the
the "Reconfigure the system" option from the first menu.
If you build a configuration that does not boot copy back
the saved version and try again.

To halt the system cleanly, type: disk/kfscmd halt

Welcome to Plan 9.
This is rc.
