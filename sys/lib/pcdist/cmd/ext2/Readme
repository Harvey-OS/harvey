Ext2srv Version 0.2
----------------

Ext2srv is a file server that interprets EXT2 file systems. Ext2srv is identical
to dossrv in specification. 

I added just one option. By default ext2srv search for the first ext2 partition
on the device (typically a disk) given by the mount spec option (see bind(1)).
So, if you have different ext2 partitions on the same disk you can select one 
of them by adding the partition number at the end of the device in the mount
system call. For example 

	mount -c /srv/ext2 /n/linux /dev/hd1disk:3

forces the server to look for ext2 filesystem on the third partition of your second
hard drive.

	Ext2srv uses some cache. So you must unmount the directory where you 
	mount your ext2 partition. It's the only way to synchronise dirty buffers
	with the disk. 

	Don't reboot your terminal (^t^t r) without explicitly unmount.

	Using something like this script is recommended :

		#!/bin/rc
	
		unmount /n/linux >[2] /dev/null
		unmount /n/linux2 >[2] /dev/null
		disk/kfscmd halt
