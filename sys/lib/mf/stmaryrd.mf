%%% 20 May 1991, v1.0: Created the font out of alans.mf and galileo.mf.
%%%
%%% 2 Jun 1992, v1.1: added the headers.

% This is the driver file for the St Mary's Road symbol font, named
% after the palatial mansion (currently under investigation by the
% Enviromental Health Officer) where we lived, and where many of the
% symbols were designed and discussed over a bottle of wine and some
% halva.
%
% Many of the symbols are derived (or `stolen', to use the technical
% phrase from Knuth's Computer Modern fonts, and the American
% Mathematical Society's msam and msbm fonts.  Please don't sue.

% We assume the parameters have been set by whichever file called us
% (for example stmary10.mf).

% Here we steal a bit from mathsy
