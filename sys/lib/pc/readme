	The Plan 9 distribution floppy is configured to bring
	the system up in CGA mode and without the mouse enabled.

	To enable the mouse you will have to run the command aux/mouse
	which takes one argument specifying the port the mouse is
	attached to.  The choices are 0, 1, or ps2. For example
		aux/mouse 0
	will set up the mouse on port 0.

	The aux/vga command will switch to one of the vga modes.  It's
	argument is the name of a file specifying the VGA parameters.
	Look at the files in the directories under /lib/vga.  Unfortunately
	there is no one configuration that works on all machines.  However
		aux/vga generic/640x480x1
	works on most vga card and monitor combinations.

	You may want to edit /rc/bin/termrc to have aux/mouse and aux/vga
	run whenever you start Plan 9.
