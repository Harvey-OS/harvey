Here is yet another quotation from Beckett, this time from \emph{Watt}
(45--46). 
\end{alltt}

\begin{quotation}
  The crocuses and the larch turning green every year a week before the others
  and the pastures red with uneaten sheep's placentas and the long summer days
  and the new-mown hay and the wood-pigeon in the morning and the cuckoo in the
  afternoon and the corncrake in the evening and the wasps in the jam and the
  smell of the gorse and the look of the gorse and the apples falling and the
  children walking in the dead leaves and the larch turning brown a week before
  the others and the chestnuts falling and the howling winds and the sea
  breaking over the pier and the first fires and the hooves on the road and the
  consumptive postman whistling \emph{The Roses Are Blooming in Picardy} and
  the standard oil-lamp and of course the snow and to be sure the sleet and
  bless your heart the slush and every fourth year the February d\`eb\^acle and
  the endless April showers and the crocuses and then the whole bloody business
  starting all over again.  
\end{quotation} 

Notice, just as one single thing among dozens, that ``crocus''
sounds like ``croak us.''
