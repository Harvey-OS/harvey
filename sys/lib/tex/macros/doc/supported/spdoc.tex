\section{Main Introduction}
In the near future this code will become part of a larger package called
|scholar| that I will release also under the GPL.  I want to make certain
useful parts of the package available before the whole package is released
because I don't see any reason to withhold them.  This is in lieu of a beta
release that would only be frustrating because I will not have time to maintain
it until May 1995.  If you find this code useful, look for the whole package
about that time.  I welcome comments, suggestions, etc.

A complement to this documentation is the file |sptest.tex| which should be
distributed with this file.  It is a \LaTeX{} file which tests almost all the
features of these packages, and thereby serves as a comprehensive example of
its use.
