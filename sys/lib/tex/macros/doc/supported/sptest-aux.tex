For a change, let's quote \emph{Moby Dick}, chapter~94:
\begin{quotation} % 
  Squeeze!\ squeeze!\ squeeze!\ all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
  till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange
  sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my
  co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.
  Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation
  beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up
  into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,---Oh!\ my dear fellow
  beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the
  slightest ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let
  us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves
  universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

  Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many
  prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases man must
  eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not
  placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the
  heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side, the country; now that I
  have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In thoughts
  of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with
  his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
