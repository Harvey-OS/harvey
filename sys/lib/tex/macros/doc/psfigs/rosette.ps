					    % This program prints a rosette
					    % design by defining a section of
					    % that design and printing that
					    % section repeatedly. This program
					    % illustrates the ``for'' and
					    % "arc" operators, and it shows
					    % how coordinate transformations
					    % can be nested so as to use the
					    % most convenient coordinate
					    % system for each part of a
					    % design.
