@COMMENT(You may put a comment in a `comment' command,
        the way you would with SCRIBE.)

Or you may dispense with the command and simply give the comment,
as long as it's not within an entry.

If you really want to put a comment inside an entry, simply
make up a never-to-be-used field.

@FAKE-ENTRY
        {fake-database-key,
        never-to-be-used-field = "Even if this were a real entry,
                I could still have a comment inside an entry
                by making up a fake field"
        }

@string (SCRIBE-NOTE = {Chapter twelve and appendices E8 through E10 deal
                        with bibliographies})

The next entry shows some of the syntactically legal things that
those with the inclination may use.@
