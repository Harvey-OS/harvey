\title{Errata to the Second Edition of the \LaTeX\ Manual}
\author{Leslie Lamport}
\date{\moddate}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\noindent These are all the errors and omissions to the manual,
\LaTeX: {\em A Document Preparation System}, second edition, published
by Addison-Wesley, reported as of \moddate.  Positions in the book are
indicated by page and line number, where the top line of a page is
number 1 and the bottom line is number $-1$.  A running head and a
page number are not considered to be lines, but all other lines are.
Please report any additional errors to {\tt lamport@src.dec.com}.


\subsection*{Errors Corrected in the First Printing}

\erratum{page 25, example of \texttt{verse} environment}
Replace \verb|{\em all\/}| by \verb|\emph{all}|.
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 28, first paragraph} 
Not an error, but it would be
helpful to add the following sentence to the end of that paragraph:
 ``(If a declaration has arguments, they become additional
arguments of the corresponding environment's \verb|\begin| command.)''


\erratum{page 33, line 10}
Add \verb|\]| to the list of fragile commands.
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 43, table 3.5}
Add an entry for \verb|\notin| ($\notin$).
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 72, two examples}
Change \verb|{\em ...}| to \verb|\emph{...}|
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 101}
This is not an error, but some readers will find it helpful if, in the
descriptions of \verb|\setlength| and \verb|\addtolength|,
\verb|\gnat| were replaced by \verb|\parskip|.  
 \reportedby{Ellen Gilkerson}{9 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 108, lines 7 and 10}
This is not an error, but it might be easier to understand
the example if \verb|\len| were replaced by something like \verb|\saved|.
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 139, lines $-8$ and $-9$}

The funny break between these two lines should be eliminated.
\reportedby{Malcolm Clark}{9 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 177, line $-12$}

The \verb|twocolumn| option cannot be used with the \verb|letters|
class.

\erratum{page 197, lines 7 and 9}

The \verb|figure*| environment is ended by \verb|\end{figure*}|, and
the \verb|table*| environment is ended by \verb|\end{table*}|.
\reportedby{Malcolm Clark}{9 Aug 94}

\erratum{page 228}

Add a note that, before running a LaTeX2.09 file in compatibility mode
in LaTeX2e, you should delete the old versions of the auxiliary files.

\subsection*{Errors in the First Two Printings}

\erratum{page53, line 24}
Change ``are needed in the'' to ``are used in the''
