========== General   ==============

-* Page i, last line (KSe)
   Replace "Signapore" with "Singapore"

========== Front matter ===========

========== Chapter 1 ==============

-* Page 2, 3rd paragraph (FMi)
   Replace "in the public domain" with "free of charge"
   as TeX is copyrighted by Donald E. Knuth and *NOT* public domain.

-* Page 2, 4th paragraph (UVi)
   In the book title `TeX and METAFONT ...', the METAFONT logo should
   be in italic.

-* Page 7, last line (MGo)
   "International Standards Organization" should be
   "International Organization for Standardization".

========== Chapter 2 ==============

-* Page 14, l. 8 (CKr)
   Add missing "be":  it will be assumed to the

-* Page 14 (FMi)
   Replace last para with:
Finally, when the \LBEG{document} is reached, all global options are
checked to see whether each of them has been used by any package; if
not, you will get a warning message. It is usually a spelling mistake
if your option name is never used; another possibility is the removal
of a \Lmcs{usepackage} command loading a package that used this
option.

-* Page 17. (JSa)
   Last sentence of 2.1.2 is unclear.
   MGo: Replace with:
 If a document is too large to process in a single run,
 it can be sub-divided into sub-parts that can be run separately.
 However, in this case, they must be processed
 \emph{in the correct sequence} to ensure that the
 cross-references and page numbers are correct.

-* Page 18, second para (FMi)
   In the front matter the so-called \emph{starred form} of the
sectioning commands is normally used.

-* Page 23, the footnote (UVi)
   there is a spurious space between TeX and book.

-* Page 31, Table 2.3 (GSa)
   \refname (default References) should appear in the table

-* Page 35,  (FMi)
   Explanation of \addtocontents and addcontentsline arguments:
   file argument contains toc lof or lot (eg without . in front)!

-* Page 37, l.6 below Table (FMi)
   A new version of the package now supports ``short'' extensions for
use in operating systems  like DOS.

-* Page 41 (FMi)
   Remove the \label{before} in the example since it does not serve
any purpose.

-* Page 41 (JSa)
   Last paragraph starting with ``\vref will produce a \ref only
      when...'' is ambiguous or misleading.
   MGo: Replace with:
 The command \Lmcs{vref} is like \Lmcs{ref} when reference and
 \Lmcs{label} are on the same page.  If label and reference differ by
 one, \Lmcs{vref} creates one of the strings: ``on the facing page,''
 ``on the preceding page,'' or ``on the following page''; the word
 ``facing'' is used when label and reference both fall onto a double
 spread.  When the difference is larger than one page, \Lmcs{vref}
 produces both \Lcs{ref} and \Lcs{pageref}.

-* Page 42 footnote (FMi)
   flafter is a package not an option!

-* Page 43 before: Language Support (FMi,JAd)
   Add: If the space added by \vpageref turns out to be wrong, as in
               (\vpageref[here]{ex:foo})
   use the variant with two optional arguments and put all text up to
   the preceding blank (in this case just the open parentheses) into both
   optional arguments, ie
               \vpageref[(here][(]{ex:foo})


========== Chapter 3 ==============

-* Page 48, third para (FMi)
   Add the following sentence: Note, that accented characters have to be
   surrounded by braces like this: \verb={\"a}=.

-* Page 50, first para (FMi)
   Remove this sentence "They are optional features ..." since
   the new version of ulem activates them automatically.

-* Page 50, example (RBa)
   Replace: "The \USA has 50 states." with "\GB was unified in 1707."

-* Page 61, first example (FMi)
   Finish line with a percent:
      \setlength{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin}}%

-* Page 64, last l. (FMi)
   Replace: "(forcing a new line)" by
            "followed by a forced line break"

-* Page 68 (PvO)
   \verbatiminput should be \verbatimtabinput (in the box)

-* Page 69 (PvO)
   \begin{listing}: I find that confusing, although I guess it is just
   the way the package works. The problem is that the required
   argument is NOT the first number that you see, but the first number
   you see = req.arg+opt.arg-1. Maybe the description can include a
   warning about this.
   MGo proposes the following text:
 An optional argument \Larg{step} specifies
 the step between numbered lines (its default value is 1,
 and it corresponds to all lines being numbered), while
 the required argument \Larg{firstline}
 is the number of the first line.
 If \Larg{step} is different from ``\Lit{1},'' then the first number
 shown will be ``\Larg{step}$+$\Larg{firstline}$-1$,'' for instance
 if the \Lmenv{listing} environment is invoked by the command
 \verb!\begin{listing}[2]{3}!, each second line
 will be numbered, starting with the number $2+3-1$, \ie $4$.

-* Page 71, figure 3.7 (PvO)
   \skip\footins is missing in the figure

-* Page 74, l.11 (FMi)
   Replace "may not match" by "will not match"

-* Page 75, 2 para (FMi)
   Replace "accumulated in memory" by "accumulated in the external file"

-* Page 75, 3 para (FMi)
   Drop "in memory" since the text is stored externally.

-* Page 80, last two paras from 3.5.5 (FMi)
   Since ftnright.sty is now updated for LaTeX2e the last two paragraphs
   can be dropped.

-* Page 82, 2nd paragraph after boxed \excludeversion (MGo)
   "\Larg{tag} is a name..." should read "\Larg{tagname} is a name..."

========== Chapter 4 ==============

-* Page 89, l 6 (FMi)
   the vpage.sty package is now available under a new name with extended
   functionality: vmargin.sty

-* Page 89, l. 10 (FMi)
   portrait and landscape should be in typewriter font since they are actual
   keywords for the optional "orient" argument of \setpapersize

-* Page 92 l. 1 (FMi)
   The first three are used ...

-* Page 92 para 4, l. 4 (CKr)
   replace: "styles is concerned" with "styles are concerned"

-* Page 93 last line (FMi)
   ... the commands \chaptermark, \sectionmark, and so on.
   FMi adds:
These commands are executed automatically by the corresponding
heading commands. They have one argument in which they receive the
heading text or its short form from the optional argument of the
heading command.

-* Page 95 l. 9 (FMi)
   Replace: by defining the commands \markboth ...
   by:      by using the commands \mathboth ...

-* Page 97 1th para (FMi)
   Replace last sentence with:
Note that in this case the length \headheight and perhaps
\footskip might have to be increased.


========== Chapter 5 ==============

-* Page 103, 2nd line of 4th para (FMi)
  replace "previous tabstop" with "following tabstop"

-* Page 104 (JPe)
   The example actually shows an ALGOL68 program (not a Pascal one)

-* Page 106 (TMa,FMi)
  Last line before footnote, in the > command:
  The 4th `{' should be a `}'

-* Page 106, footnote (FMi)
  ... in case of p, m, or b, the ...

-* Page 108 (WLe)
  Replace first sentence with:
When you have a narrow column, you must not only make sure that the
first word can be hyphenated (see page~\pageref{sec:allowhyphenation})
but consider that short texts are easier to typeset in ragged right
mode (without being aligned at the right margin).

-* Page 108 l. 5 (FMi)
   Replace "environment" by "command"

-* Page 108 example (FGo)
   Replace "superconciousness" by "superconsciousness"

   Replace "superconciousness" by "superconsciousness" 

-* Page 116 l. 3 bottom (FMi)
   Replace: "`c' columns" by "`c', `r', or `l' columns"

-* Page 120 following (FPo)
   Shouldn't  Table 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.7 (and perhaps others) better be
   Figures, like a lot of other examples presenting tabulated LaTeX output?
  MGo: I have renamed all example "tables", namely 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5,
   and 5.7 into figures

-* Page 122 (FMi)
   It could be helpful to explicitly mention that one shouldn't use \nofiles
   together with longable since longtable needs to write to the aux file.
   It would be even better if longtable would dectect this problem.
MGo added footnote:
This means that the \Lcs{nofiles} command, that suppresses
writing of all but the \Lfn{dvi} and \Lfn{log} files,
should not be used together with the \Lmpack{longtable} package.}

-* Page 128 (FMi)
   Replace:
    \LTchunksize   (20) Number of rows per chunk (TeX counter)
   with
     LTchunksize   (20) Number of rows per chunk (LaTeX counter)
   Both is correct but why mention the TeX version?

-* Page 129, text l.4 bottom (FMi)
   Replace: "output file" by "output"

-* Page 133, 1st l. of 5.6.3
   Replace: "in narrow" with "between narrow"

-* Page 135 (MGo) first para of multirow section
   The author of the multirow package is no longer unknown; it is
   Jerry Leichter.

-* Page 137 (FMi)
   \firsthline and \lasthline will be part of array.sty with the next
   release.

========== Chapter 6 ==============

-* Page 143, l8 from bottom (MOh)
   It should read "you can prevent" instead of "you can prevents"

-* Page 144, example (UJa)
   Better use \renewcommand, since new command is only correct if you
   design a class file from scratch.

-* Page 145 l.11 (TMa)
  `ignoreed' should be `ignored'

-* Page 148 (WLe)
   Fig 6.1: The left and right sides do not correspond in detail

-* Page 153, para 2, l.3 (KCr)
   Replace: (defined by default as (\alph{subfigure})\space}
   with:    , defined by default as (\alph{subfigure})\space,

-* Page 155, \@makecaption and \@isucaption example (JvM,FMi)
   In both cases is a closing brace missing:
   \ifthenelse{\lengthtest{\wd\tempbox > \linewidth}}%
                                            %%%     ^ closing brace

========== Chapter 7 ==============

-* Page 164  Figure 7.6 (TMa)
  The 10pt font is actually Lucida Bright and the  magnified
  one Computer Modern 5 pt, so it whould be better to use CMR twice

-* Page 167 (PAp)
   If you used ... should read: If you use ...

 * Page 174 third para (UVi)
   Computer Modern Typewriter has not even bold extended series only
   medium.

-* Page 174 fourth para (CMi)
   Replace by:
   An example in which some default values are changed can be found in
the chapter about PostScript (section 11.9.6 on page 339).

-* Page 182 (FJe)
   Table 7.6 is incomplete. Nowadays there is the following set of fonts
   available from labrea.stanford.edu:
Concrete Roman medium: ccr5 ccr6 ccr7 ccr8 ccr9 ccr10
Concrete Roman medium italic: ccti10
Concrete Roman medium slanted: ccsl9 ccsl10
Concrete Roman medium caps and small caps: cccsc10
Concrete Roman condensed slanted: ccslc9

-* Page 182 (WLe)
   Table 7.7: Examples of Pandora fonts are incorrect:
Pandora Roman bold      is typeset in     (again) Pandora Roman medium
Pandora Sans            is typeset in     Pandora Roman slanted
Pandora Sans bold       is typeset in     Pandora Roman bold

 * Page 184 (FMi)
   The packages euscript and eufrak have been moved into the amsfonts
   distribution. euscript is now considered obsolete (but available)
   and the following is provided:

\usepackage{eufrak}     defines \mathfrak (and \EuFrak for compatibility)
\usepackage{eucal}      or
\usepackage[mathcal]{eucal}     changes \mathcal to use euler script fonts
\usepackage[mathscr]{eucal}     defines \mathscr to use euler script fonts
                                and leaves \mathcal alone
\usepackage{euscript}   defines \EuScript (considered obsolete)

 * Page 185, l.4 (CMi)
   Replace chose by choose

 * Page 196, second para from bottom (CMi)
   Since a size function can have both an optional and a mandatory argument
   this para should speak about arguments in plural (two occasions)

 * Page 200, l 8. (FMi)
   ... with a font family as a whole.

 * Page 203 (FMi)
   The starting letters T, O, M, and S are reserved for standard encodings
                                 ^^^^^
 * Page 206, top (FMi)
   Replace the sentence: In fact, only the \DeclareFontEncoding ....
   by: If the encoding of the font is unknown to NFSS it must be first
       declared with \DeclareFontEncoding in the package file. The
       other two declaration can, in fact, alternatively be placed
       into a .fd file.

 * Page 208, l.6 (CMi)
   Replace: "you can define them"  by  "you can define it"
   since the math alphabet and not the letters are defined.

 * Page 209 (FMi)
   The following declaration is also part of the default setup:
      \SetSymbolFont{symbols}{bold}{OMS}{cmsy}{b}{n}

 * Page 211 (FMi)
   In explanation for "Checking defaults for <cdp>/<font shape>
   replace \DeclareFontEncoding by \DeclareFontSubstitution.

========== Chapter 8 ==============

-* Page 214 (FMi)
   Remove second reference to Graetzer's book ([95]).

-* Page 217 (GSa)
   Note that the Companion uses Lucida math fonts which contain the
   standard LaTeX and AmS symbols but with different shapes compared
   to the Computer Modern math fonts.

 * Page 218 (FMi)
   In amslatex release 1.2:
   \Bbb, \frak are OBSOLETE. Use \mathbb, \mathfrak.

 * Page 219 table 8.5 (JPe)
   Put a comma between \leq and \le.
   Also show that the "greater equal sign" can be produced by \geq and \ge.
   
 * Page 224 (FMi)
   In amslatex release 1.2:
   \accentedsymbol was moved to package amsxtra.

 * Page 225 (FMi)
   In amslatex release 1.2:
   All supercripted accents \sphat, etc. were moved to package amsxtra.

 * Page 228 (FMi)
   In amslatex release 1.2:
   \operatornamewithlimits is OBSOLETE: new name is \operatorname*.

 * Page 229 (FMi)
   We should add a line with \bmod to the first example.

   In amslatex release 1.2:
   \fracwithdelims was moved to package amsxtra.

 * Page 230 (FMi)
   In amslatex release 1.2:
   \lcfrac, \rcfrac are OBSOLETE. New syntax is \cfrac{...}{...} or
   \cfrac[l]{...}{...} to get left-positioned numerators or \cfrac[r]...

 * Page ??? (FMi)
   In amslatex release 1.2:
   New subequations environment, for example
   \begin{subequations}{a}
   ...
   \end{subequations}
   causes all numbered equation environments within that scope to be
   numbered (4.9a) (4.9b) (4.9c) etc. if the preceding numbered
   equation was 4.8. The argument can be a,A,i,I,1,f for the standard
   LaTeX numbering types: \alph, \Alph, \roman, \Roman, \arabic,
   \fnsymbol.  A \label command immediately after
   \begin{subequations}{...} will produce a \ref of the parent number
   "4.9", not "4.9a". The counters used by the subequations environment
   are `parentequation' and `equation' and standard uses of
   \addtocounter, \setcounter, etc. are possible with those counter
   names.

-* Page 236, l.2 bottom (FMi)
   Start a new sentence at:  Each one is ...

-* Page 241 (FMi)
   Say that righttag is an option to the amstex package.

 * Page 241 (FMi)
   The errata above is probably already obsolete again, option is now
   reqno/leqno and default isn't any longer on the left.

-* Page 243 (GGr,FMi)
   To the entries for amscd and amssymb add:
   This package is not automatically included by the amstex package.

     amsthm             theorem code for classes
     amsintsm           special integral syntax
   New options have been added to classes:
     8pt,9pt            sizes
     fleqn              is now supported
     nomath             don't load amstex package
   New options to amstex package:

-* Page 250 (TMa)
  Just before Section 8.7.6: `align*' should be `align'
  like it says in the text.

 * Page 256 (FMi)
   Since amstex 1.2 will place the formula number now by default to the
   right the last paragraph needs correction.

-* Page 256 (FMi)
   Replace: All these parameters are expressed as lengths ...
   with: All these are length parameters ...

   A truly international TeX also need support for different
   typesetting directions, ie TeX-XeT.

-* Page 261 (FMi)
   "to the 256-bit DC-font glyphs" should better read:
   "to the 256 glyphs of a DC-font"

-* Page 264 (WLe)
   Bottom of page: The example at the end "Drucker bzw. Druk-ker" etc.
   are not very useful, since they don't show the commands.

-* Page 264 (PvO)
   The footnote text is confusing (I have to read it twice to
   understand). I suggest that it says: Note that the original package
   is incompatible..

-* Page 265 (FMi)
   \adddialect{dialect-name}{language}

-* Page 267, table 9.2 (JBr)
   Macro \alsoseename is actually called \alsoname in BABEL

   Macro \headpagename is actually called \pagename in BABEL

 * Page 270 (FMi)
   My version of epsfig doesn't support textures with eps files,
   so i guess that example is not correct (but i may not have latest
   graphics)

-* Page 270, caption (FMi)
   Example using babel's option french (output on the facing page)

-* Page 273 (JPe)
   The , after \begin{order} should be replaced by a blank

   Replace: ...associated with their names
   by:      ...associated with them

========== Chapter 10 =============

-* Page 275, footnote (FMi)
   Remove the colon in the citation text.
  
-Page 275, 1st para(FMi)
   Add a footnote like this:
In certain situations it is possible for the \special command to
change the formatting because it can produce an additional break point
and it might prevent LaTeX from noticing spaces.

-* Page 277 (PvO)
   Better use \setlength{\sdim}{1.5\sboxsep}.
   Also show in the example that you don't use the default of 10pt.

-* Page 277 (FMi)
   In the first printing we used some modified version of the shadow
   package (with unofficial names). In the second printing we somehow
   got it wrong  again (the last shadow box is suposed to have a
   larger shadow), sigh. it Should read:
\setlength{\sdim}{3\fboxsep}
   in the example.

-* Page 278, description of \ovalbox (FMi)
   Replace with:
The width of the frame is defined by the \Lcs{thinlines} command. The
diameter of the corner arcs is set with a \Lmcs{cornersize} command.
The form \Lmcs{cornersize}\Largb{num} sets the diameter to \Larg{num}
$\times$ minimum(width of box, height of box); the form
\Lmcs{cornersize*}\Largb{len} sets the diameter to \Larg{len}.  The
default is \Lmcs{cornersize}\verb={0.5}=.

-* Page 282 (FMi)
   In the syntax box for \root(x-.... show the space after the )
   better explicitly.  It is needed!

   A set of electronic circuit symbols developed by
   \Author{Adrian Johnstone} is available (on CTAN) as part of his 
   \texttt{lcircuit} system to be used with the \TeX{}cad program
   (see figure~\vref{fig:lcircuit}).

-* Page 294, bottom (JPe)
   Logically item 3 + 4 needs exchanging

-* Page 295, l. 2 (FMi)
   Replace: "shortest line" by "shortest available line"

-* Page 296, l. 6 (FMi)
   Replace: than the equivalent "$n_1$" \multiput statements,
   with:    than multiple \multiput statements.

-* Page 306, l. 3 bottom (FMi)
   Replace: for subsequent \draw commands
   by:      for subsequent \match commands

-* Page 307, def. of \drawwith (FMi)
   Argument should be named "draw-command" since it can contain only
   a single command

========== Chapter 11 =============

-* Page 316, table 11.1 (FMi)
   Mention -pp\# (single page) and -pp\#$_1$:\#$_2$ (page range).

-* Page 318 (FMi)
   Remove the double quotes around clip= and the quotes around = in
   the explanation of the clip parameter.

-* Page 321 (FPo)
   The caption for figure 11.4 could use some negative space between
   "Pre-" and "1991".

-* Page 321, code for figure 11-x (VSc)
    The nineth line should be unindented:
     6 \begin{minipage}
     7    \centering\epsfig
     8    \caption{Central
     9 ...\end{minipage}

-* Page 321 (RSt)
   Perhaps we should learn about history better: make the caption
   of figure 11.4:  Pre-1990 Europe

-* Page 321 (PKr)
   It would be better to show that the example is coded as a figure by
   surrounding the code with \begin{figure} ... \end{figure}.

-* Page 328, description of \cbstart (MOh)
   ...the beginning of the region, which has to be flagged...
                                 ^no comma needed here

-* Page 331 (BBe)
  first figure using \psboxit, the dashes formed by

========== Chapter 12 =============

-* Page 350, first examples (FMi)
   The last line of the first examples should read
      \index{tabbing|)textit}
   otherwise MakeIndex would complain about it.

-* Page 350, l. 4 from bottom (FMi)
   Replace {\it rose} with \textit{rose}. Not wrong but better.

-* Page 351, l. 2 (FMi)
   Replace: of the definition of the \Prog program.
   with:    of the definition of the \Prog command.

-* Page 352, l. 2+3  (FMi)
   Replace:
For example, you can define the command \Index, whose argument enters
its argument at the same time in the text and in the index.
   with:
For example, you can define the command \Index, whose argument is
entered at the same time in the text and in the index.

-* Page 353-354 (FMi,MGo)
   The figures shown in the makeindex processing example are not
   reflecting what is in the source on p354 (one index entry was dropped
   there). 
   Correction: Add in section "Preparing the Index" an index
   entry \index{include index} as follows:
     \texttt{idx} file has to be transformed by an external
     program, like \Prog{makeindex}.\index{include index}

-* Page 354 (PvO)
   The example should show a \makeindex command.

 * Page 354 (FMi)
   The lefthand side of the example should use the verbatim environment
   not the verbatimcmd environment which is only defined when the moreverb
   package is used. Also the example should show
   \renewenvironment{theindex}{..}{..}

-* Page 354 (FMi)
   The right hand side shows an index entry "include index" which
   isn't any longer in the source :-(

-* Page 355 (FMi)
   It should say (in one line):
   makeindex [-ciglqr]
      [-o \Larg{ind}] [-p \Larg{no}] [-s \Larg{sty}] [-t \Larg{log}]
      [\Larg{idx0} \Larg{idx1} ...]
   with \Larg giving italics indicating variable names

 * Page 355 description of -g (FMi)
   Not an error in the book but in the program: work correctly only in
   version 2.13 of Makeindex (2.12 dies with larger files).

-* Page 355 (PvO)
   It should say:
   -o \emph{ind}        Take the file \emph{ind} as the output index file.

-* Page 355 description of -p no(FMi)
   "no" should always be in italics not typewriter.
   the words "any", "odd", and "even" should be always in typewriter.

-* Page 356 (FMi)
   It should say:
   -s \emph{sty}        Take the file \emph{sty} as the index style file.

-* Page 356 (PvO)
   It should say:
   -t \emph{log}        Use \emph{log} as the transcript file.

-* Page 356 (FMi)
   It should say:
     Extra `@' at position ...

-* Page 357 Inconsistent page ...(FMi)
   Replace: \index{cat|iv}   by:  \index{cat|see{animals}}


-* Page 358 (PvO)
   The description of escape is very confusing.
   (FMi:) agreed, what about (FMi, MGo):
   quote     symbol that escapes the character following it.
   escape    symbol without special meaning unless followed by 
             the quote character in which case that character 
             looses its special function and both will be printed.

-* Page 358 (FMi)
   Replace
    (s) signals an attribute of type string, (c) of type char
   with
    (s) attribute of type string, (c) of type char (surround with single or
    double quotes, respectively)

-* Page 358, end of first para (FMi)
   Add: Makeindex uses UNIX string syntax in the style file. For this
   reason one has to enter \\ to get a single \ in the output.

 * Page 359 (PvO)
   Description of delim_t is missing.

-* Page 359, delim_0 (FMi)
   Replace: entry-page number delimiter at level 0
   by:      delimiter between entry and first page number at level 0
   (because the original is not understandable)

-* Page 359, encap_suffix (FMi)
   Remove surplus dot in default:   "}"

-* Page 359 (SMi)
   In Makeindex 2.12 and higher up
   page_precedence(s) is  "rnaRA"
   Therefore the examples on page 363 should be the other way around.

 * Page 364 (RWo)
   Remind the reader how to use a file not ending with .idx with
   Makeindex.

-* Page 364+365 (FMi)
   The redefinition of theindex environment should set \parindent to zero
   otherwise one ends up with all entries except the first being indented.

-* Page 365 (WLe)
    According to the text on page 365, The index in the example should
    have three columns instead of two.
FMi: change this sentence to something like this:
    ... we have used a redefined theindex environment similar to the one
    shown in section 12.5 but with two columns and without the \newpage.

-* Page 366 fig 12.8 (FMi)
   This looks like the "spot the ten differences pictures:
     Replace: \renewcommand[2]{\printindex}{%
         by : the correct order of arguments :-(
     Add a \ in front of textbf in definition of \printindex
     Add a proper definition of \Prog and \Com, they are not the same
         as in fig 12.8.
     Outline that \renewenvironment{theindex}{...}{...}
     Indent \input{#1.ind}   (this is cosmetics)
     and don't use \begin{center} use \section*   (cosmetics too)

-* Page 367 item 5 (FMi)
   Replace: \renewcommand{\indexproofstyle}{\footnotesize\itshape}
   by:      \indexproofstyle{\footnotesize\itshape}

========== Chapter 13 =============

-* Page 373 l. -2 (FMi)
   Replace  sentence (was not correct) with:
 The punctuation characters (.,;:) will be moved in front of the
 superscript which might be incorrect in case the \Lcs{cite}
 immediately follows a quotation, e.g.,
     \verb=``The \TeX book''\cite{Knuth}.=  
 gives ``The \TeX book''.$^5$


 * Page 378 (UVi)
   The table of .bst files list some styles named phxxx.bst, where xxx
   stands for abbreviations like aip, nf, pf, ppcf etc. On CTAN these
   styles are now located in a subdirectory phy-bstyles and they no
   longer carry the prefix ph in their name. It would be a good idea
   to update this in the Companion, because otherwise people looking
   for the names with the famous 'quote site index' might not find
   them. (MGo: in fact they are there onder both names)
Comment (FMi): I'm right now reluctant to change anything since i wonder
whether those names will stay. It seems wrong to me that the names
(prefix) have changed.

 * Page 378 (UVi)
   (ph)ppcf.bst is described as ``a physics version of the apalike
   BibTeX style''.  This might be true somehow, but a better
   describtion would be ``BibTeX style for Plasma Physics and
   Controlled Fusion'', since that is the name of the journal the
   abbreviation ppcf stands for (see physjabb).
   (ph)report.bst is described as ``BibTeX style for internal
   reports''.  It might be a good idea to add some hint that this
   probably refers to the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab or Princeton
   University.
   (MGo: Perhaps in a future edition).

-* Page 385, line 7 (PvO)
  "only works without modifications on UNIX" is probably a bit too
   harsh: It is meant that modifications are necessary for systems
   such as MS-DOS that have file names with strict length limits. 
   By the way should UNIX not be typeset with small capitals?
   MGo: No, ATT (and most publishers) spell it all uppercase.

-* Page 386 l.3 of 13.3.2 (FMi)
   Replace "style" by "package".

-* Page 387 l.1  (FMi)
   The root file should be called chapterbibexa.tex (as in the
   formatting example on page 385)

-* Page 388, caption (RSt)
   For "advisable precedure" read "advisable procedure".

-* Page 392, 4th para (CMi)
   The argument of the \bibliography command must ...

-* Page 392, after example (FMi)
   Add: ... after the BibTeX run unless the bibliography entries
        themselves contain citations to other entries
        (eg note = {reviewed in \cite{..}}).

-* Page 393, bibextract (FMi)
   the regular expression must (!) contain only lowercase chars (even
   when looking for words like "Adobe") otherwise nothing will be found.
   Thus our examples should read:
bibextract "" "postscript" bibfile(s) > new-bibfile
bibextract "author|organisation" "adobe" bibfile(s) > new-bibfile

-* Page 393, bibextract (FMi)
   Another restriction: 
   one might have to clean the .bib files using
   bibclean before bibextract finds correct entries.

-* Page 393, l. 6. bottom (FMi)
   while the next command will only extract those entries containing
   Adobe in the author or organization field.

-* Page 393, last para, 394 first para (FMi,Mgo)
   replace "citefind.sh" by "citefind"
   replace "citetags.sh" by "citetags"

-* Page 394, l. 4 (CMi)
   For "styles" read "files".

-* Page 403 (MOl)
   A comma is missing after:   @article(tub-87,

-* Page 403, 1st para (CMi)
   Replace all ".bib style" with ".bib file".

-* Page 404, 1st example (FMi)
   Use \providecommand instead of \newcommand now that it is available.

-* Page 413, add.period (PvO)
   Should read: adds dot to string unless that string ends with `.',
   `?', or `!'

========== Chapter 14 =============

-* Page 424 (FMi)
   Add \Finale to the box with \StopEventually{final text} since they
   belong together.

-* Page 426, figure 14.1 (FMi)
   It should be \DocInput{docexam.doc} because .dtx is reserved for
   files whose documentation can be produced by simply running them
   through LaTeX.

-* Page 426, line 4 of section 14.2.7. (PAp)
   You should run the file thought ...
should read:
   You should run the file through ...

-* Page 427, figure 14.2 (FMi)
   The \item in the definition of "docsampleenv" should be removed.
   Also: the documentation of "docsampleenv" is incorrect.

-* Page 429 (FMi)
   Replace the heading: Document structure and validation support
   by: Document structure commands

-* Page 433, 6 para (FMi)
   Not only NFSS2 but the whole LaTeX (2e) is now distributed using
   the doc system.

 * Page 433, Section 14.3.1 (Msc,FMi)
   Mention that \preamble ...\endpreamble is meant for straight text and
   that nearly no command will work between. One can use \string\foo to
   put out a command name literally.

-* Page 434, l. 10 (FMi)
   Replace: \batchfile Batch file commands can be ...
   with:    Batch file commands, like \generateFile, can be ...

-* Page 434, l. -9 (FMi)
   Replace the sentence: Note that these tags must ...
   By:  The tags must be placed at the beginning of the line
        preceded by a %, e.g.,

-* Page 437+438 (ASc)
   In the second last code line the \@@end should be replaced by
   \csname @@end\endcsname since otherwise \@@end isn't recognised
   in most situations. This also means that the checksum changes to 15.

========== Appendix A =============

-* Page 440, second example (FMi)
   It should better be: \newcommand{\PsI}{\Ps\index{PostScript}}

-* Page 440 (RWo)
   Use the same formula in the last two examples to show the advantage
   of \ensuremath better.

-* Page 476 (FMi)
   Add to the description of \newcounter:
   It also defines \thenewctr to be \arabic{newctr}.

-* Page 447 (MSc)
   A counter can't be larger than 9 if used with \fnsymbol.

-* Page 477 (FMi)
   All the \the... commands in the examples should be defined with
   \renewcommand.

-* Page 450, table A.2 (FMi)
   \hfill is better described as a "rubber space" not a rubber length.

 * Page 456, last para (FMi)
   Replace: "In the case below" by "In the next case" since the next
   example is on the following page.

-* Page 459 (FMi)
   Add "x333x" after \usebox{\myboxb} in the example (just cosmetics).

-* Page 461, table A.4 (WLe)
   For \Requirepackage read \RequirePackage in the explanation of
   \LoadClass.

-* Page 470, 5 text l. from bottom (FMi)
   Replace "(real or integer)" by "integer". They can't be real!

-* Page 470 following (CRo)
   In the description of the ifthen package, no clear distinction is
   made between those commands which can be used only in a
   {test}-argument, and those which are for other uses.

-* Page 472 (RWo)
   The index entries in the .idx file would actually look like this
   (remove the surplus "page:AAAA1" in the middle of them):
        \indexentry{AAAA!both}{472}
        \indexentry{AAAA!indexentry}{472}
        \indexentry{AAAA!indexonly}{472}

========== Appendix B =============

 * Page 475 (FMi)
   Maybe rename the heading to "TeX Software and User Group information"

 * Page 475 (FMi)
   Add information about the possibility to get the CTAN software on CD:
     \bibitem{primetime:VBr94}
     Vicki Brown, editor.
     \newblock {\em Prime Time {\TeX}cetera}, volume~1.
     \newblock Prime Time Freeware, Sunnyvale, CA, 1994.
     \newblock Contains CD with CTAN software.

 * Page 477, l 13 (FMi)
   should read: contents of the morebin zip archive on your local node.
                                        ^^^            ^

 * Page 479 (BBe) under b.2 mail servers
   i am irked by the difference in the depth of the underline under
   "end" right after "send help";
   maybe you could be persuaded to use a strut? (BBe)

========== Bibliography ===========

 * Page 491 (RWo)
   The name is Peter Vollenweider; somebody inverted the `w'---mea culpa.

========== Index ==================

   (BBe)
   i was a little surprised to find the listing for "tex users group"
   where one would expect to find "tug" in the index, although "tug"
   doesn't appear in the entry.  i also would have expected to see
   p.260 listed with that entry, considering the reference there to
   the twgmlc and the portland meeting.

   the people who were acknowledged in the preface don't show up in
   the index.  although it's not necessary, of course, knuth did
   include his acknowledgees and sources of quotes in the texbook
   index, so there's a precedent.

 * (FMi)
   There should be entries for all encodings, OT1, T1, OML, OMS, OMX,
   at least to page 192, perhaps to others.

 * Page 493 (FMi)
   The two funny looking entries of the form "\, 220"  actually should
   be     \{, 220
          \}, 220

-* Page 497 (GGr)
   Add entry for "Blackboard bold" pointing to page 218
   Also add one pointing to page 208  (MPi)
   And add a similar entry for \Bbb   (MPi)

 * Page 500 (FMi)
   \cornersize is incorrecly indexed as "rigid length"

 * Page 501 (FMi)
   \DeclareFontSubstitution should have bold entry to page 203.

-* Page 506 (CRo)
   Add index entry for "Fragile command" and "Commands, fragile"
   to point to 246 and 471

-* Page 508 (FMi)
   Index entry for \IndexMin should be a "rigid length"

 * Page 509 (PvO,FMi)
   Reference 249 for \left should be 248. (This is probably true for
   other entries pointing to the example section of chapter 8, because
   index entries to the examples are placed after the example.)

-* Page 519 (FMi)
   environment supertabular is incorrectly indexed under \supertabular.

 * Page 520 (PvO)
   Reference 249 for \right should be 248.

-* Page 527 (FMi)
   \unitlength is incorrecly indexed as as a command

========== General   ===========

* Some source files in the LaTeX2e distribution have got new names,
for example latex.tex -> lt....dtx (many files). The final
distribution is still under construction.


========== Front matter ===========

-* Title Page
  Drop IPS, from affiliation of Samarin (just leave ISO)

-* Copyright page
  Add second printing

-* Table of Contents, Page xviii
  10.5 should read "Packages Based on epic

-* Table of Contents, Page xxi
  Page number of Bibliography should be 481

-* Table of Contents, Page xxiii
  5.8 A comparison (not A Comparison)


========== Chapter 1 ===========

-* Page 3 last para (SKi)
  files containing the structures and layout definitions (extension
  .sty) should also include extension .cls

-* Page 4 (JSa)
  Add clo to LaTeX layout & structure file extensions

-* Page 5 third par (GGr)
  In Textures, the transcript file has no extension.


========== Chapter 2 ===========

-* Page 13 (PHa)
  4th bullet item:  define your own   (not OUR own)

-* Page 15 (JSa)
  1994/08/02 should also be 1994/08/01

-* Page 29 (NPo)
  fig 2.9: braces round argument `title' and `toc_entry' missing.
  (very strange this)

-* Page 37, l.6 below Table (GGr)
  Extension .mtc<N> will not work in DOS (Windows).

-* Page 44 (JSa,FMi)
  The default for \reftextfaraway was missing.
  Also changed the local adaption example to use \RequirePackage
with a reference to Appendix A.

========== Chapter 3 ===========

-* Page 48 (LLa)
  The paragraph above the example unfortunately doesn't describe the
example any longer, it describes an old version of it.

-* Page 52 (OBa)
  \fuzzy should be \fussy (3 lines above title 3.1.5...)

-* Page 52 (SKi)
  The multispace package was written by Stephen (not Stephan) Page.

-* Page 59 (FMi)
  The representation of \labelitemiv is missing. This seems to be
a``correction'' of the printer people since the dot is in the
PostScript file!

-* Page 62 (MGo)
  More general (and more correct) description of general list
parameters. Especially the relation between the \labelwidth and
\itemindent lengths are made clearer.

-* Page 65 (DCa)
  The labels in the Mentry env are aligned on the top of their *boxes*
not on their first baselines. (A buggy \parbox[t] implementation on
the way to LaTeX2e)

-* Page 67 (NPo)
  \begin{verbatimtab}[...] instead of \verbatimtab[...]  since we
describe an environment

-* Page 70 (FMi)
  verbatimwrite is incorrectly mentioned as a command but it is an
environment. Also correct index entry.

-* Page 71 (DCa)
  stepping the mpfootnote counter
should be
  stepping the footnote counter


========== Chapter 4 ===========

-* Page 86 (FMi)
  testpage.tex in LaTeX2e now asks interactively for the paper your
printer uses so there isn't any need to use testa4.tex any longer.

-* Page 94-95 (FMi)
   Replace para starting at the bottom with:
The marking commands work reasonably well for right markers ``numbered
within'' left markers (for example, when the left marker is changed by
a \Lcs{chapter} command and the right marker is changed by a
\Lcs{section} command).  However, it produces somewhat anomalous
results if a \Lcs{markboth} command is preceded by some other mark
command on the same page---see the page receiving \texttt{L5 R3.2} in
Figure~\vref{fig:pagemarkers}. This figure shows schematically which
left and right markers are generated for pages being shipped out.

-* Page 95 (FMi)
   Replace the last four lines in figure 4.3 with the following five
   lines:
\markboth{L4}{}                   {L4}{}
\markboth{L5}{}                   {L5}{}
\newpage%    ----page break ----                   L5      R3.2
\markright{R5.1}                  {L5}{R5.1}
\end{document}                                     L5      R5.1



-* Page 97 (GGr,FMi)
  Replace begin of second para with:

Some \LaTeX{} commands, like \Lcs{chapter}, use a \Lcs{thispagestyle}
command to automatically switch to the \Psty{plain} page style, thus
overriding the page style currently in effect.  To customize such
pages use the \Pmsty{fancyplain} page style.  This page style sets up
\Psty{fancy} for normal pages and in addition ...

-* Page 98 (EPi)
  \usestylefile{fancyheadings}   (in bottom example)
should be
  \usepackage{fancyheadings}

-* Page 99 (EPi)
  \usestylefile{fancyheadings}   (in figure 4.6)
should be
  \usepackage{fancyheadings}

-* Page 99 (FMi)
  \samepage is considered obsolete in LaTeX2e and will not be
documented by Leslie Lamport in his book; the relevant paragraph has
been rephrased.


========== Chapter 5 ===========

-* Page 111 (OBa)
   "substracting" should be "subtracting" (12th line from top)

-* Page 120 (DKre,FPo)
   Bring Example text and table 5.3 in synch

-* Page 121 (DKre,FPo)
   Bring Example text and table 5.4 in synch

-* Page 123 (FMi,FPo)
   Bring Example text and table 5.5 in synch

-* Page 127 (FPo)
   The bottom left figure seems to have a quote before Tsonga
This is a printing artefact.

-* Page 127 (PvO)
   Bottom left figure, there is also some spurious ink before
   Croatian.

-* Page 127 Table 5.7 (FPo)
  In the last `page' the code for Tsonga appears as 'ts, with a quote
in front of it. It might be a blob of ink, but it looks very much like
a quote. (It is a blob of extra ink, and this was missed by the
printer, compare p59.  FMi:-)

-* Page 128 (FMi)
  Lowercase word "comparison" in caption for table 5.8
  Also correct lot entry page xxiii.

-* Page 133 (MGo)
  In table 5.9 URW is misspelled as URM


========== Chapter 6 ===========

-* Page 151 (MGo)
  Figure 6.2, the vertical lines of the box surrounding the map
  are partly invisible (printing problem)


========== Chapter 7 ===========

-* Page 170 l. 9, f.b. (GGr)
  Change sentence to: Font metric files (i.e., .tfm files) are loaded
for all intermediate typefaces, even if these fonts are never used.

-* Page 171 caption (GGr)
  Change
          easy memorable
  to
          easily memorizable

-* Page 171 (FMi,LLa)
  The default for \nocorrlist was changed to
\newcommand{\nocorrlist}{,.}
  in the LaTeX distribution because :; do not look right with the
default LaTeX fonts from the Computer Modern families.

-* Page 177 (FMi,LLa)
  The example shows that \mathnormal produces italic numbers. This is
only true for the Lucida Math Fonts used in the Companion. Thus, the
following footnote should be added to the expanation:
  \footnote{With the default setup of \LaTeXe{} using Computer Modern
math fonts, \Lmcs{mathnormal} will produce old style numerals, not the
italic ones shown in the example, where Lucida is used.}

-* Page 180 in 7.5, l. 3 (GGr)
  section B should be Appendix B

-* Page 180 l. 3 f.b.  (GGr,FMi)
  `Consequentially' should be `Consequently';
   in the same sentence change `used' to `uses'.

-* Page 186 l. 8 f.b. (GGr)
   Add space before `This'

-* Page 187 last line (GGr)
   Captialize: new font selection scheme

 * Page 199 top (FMi)
   NFSS now doesn't load math fonts until unless it encounters
   a formula in the new size. So the first para needs alteration.

-* Page 191 last line (FMi)
   Add: For this to work the encoding OT2 must be declared in the
preamble or a package file.

-* Page 194 (FMi)
  \cmdunh10.tfm
should be
  cmdunh10.tfm

-* Page 195, 197 (FMi)
  Again all .tfm files shouldn't have \ in front of their names

-* Page 201 (MGo)
  substract should be subtract on second line explaining \fontdimen4

-* Page 202 (FMi)
  For peamble read preamble

-* Page 204 (GGr)
  fontdef.tex was renamed to fontdef.ltx in the final distribution
  (also correct index entry)

-* Page 205, last para (SMi)
 [...], you first have make the typeface [...]
should be
 [...], you first have to make the typeface [...]

-* Page 211 (FMi)
  Warning message "Check substitution defaults for ..." was changed to
"Checking defaults for ...". Also change \DeclareFontEncoding to
\DeclareFontSubstitution in last sentence of explanation for this
message.

-* Page 211 (FMi)
  The message "Don't use ..." was changed to "Command ... invalid in
math mode".

-* Page 211 (FMi)
  The message "Encoding scheme <name> changed to <new name> in ..."
has changed to "Encoding <name> has changed to <new name> for ..."

-* Page 213 (FMi)
  New message added:

\erritem{Overwriting \m{something} in version \m{name} ...}

A declaration, like \Lcs{SetSymbolFont} or \Lcs{DeclareMathAlphabet},
has changed the assignment of font shapes to \m{something} (a symbol
font or a math alphabet) in the math version \m{name}.

-* Page 214 (FMi)
  New message added:

\erritem{Size substitutions with differences up to \m{size} have occured}

This message will appear at the end of the run in case \NFSS{}
selected at least one significantly different size because the
requested size was not available.  The \m{size} is the maximum
deviation that was needed.

-* Page 214 (FMi)
  New message added:

\erritem{Some font shapes were not available, defaults substituted}

This message will appear at the end of the run in case \NFSS{}
had to use automatic font substitution for some font shapes.


========== Chapter 8 ===========

-* Page 215 (FMi,MGo)
   Added a reference to George~Gr\"atzer's book on AmSLaTeX.
   Also add bibliography [95] (see bibliography section later)

-* Page 218 (DCa)
   \o
   should be
   o

-* Page 219 (DCa)
  `blank' \rown
      should be
   /-\    \frown   (didnt this one create a TeX error :-)
                   (FMi no because of TeX's \csname bug :-( )


-* Page 219, 222 (DRo,FMi)
  The \varnothing and \emptyset do show the wrong
character, ie need exchanging.

-* Page 220 (DCa)
  { should be \{
  } should be \}

-* Page 220, Table 8.13. (LLa)
   Is that \digamma right?  It looks an awful lot like a slanted
   F to me.
This is unfortunately true. The Lucida Fonts do not contain that
character and we overlooked that the font setup simply points to the
slanted F.

-* Page 222, Table 8.20 (FMi)
  The characters \Game \Finv \Bbbk \diagdown \diagup are now part of
amssymb.sty

-* Page 231 (DCa)
  The \biggl( in the scope of \begin{large} is *smaller* than the
normalsize one!

-* Page 238 (DCa)
  The examples of split environment with and without the ctagsplt
option do not work as the linewidth is too narrow, so in both cases
the tag apears on the line before the display.

-* Page 241 (PHa)
  The typeset equation just before (8.41') should have a tag: '
  (This is once more a printer problem. the tag ' is in the PS file
and must have been removed by somebody manually)
To avoid this problem the example was changed to show $*$ twice.

-* Page 243 (FMi)
Replace fist sentence of 8.6.5 with:
  A few options are recognized by the amstex package and the class
  files coming with AmS-LaTeX.
(but this is still only true for the 2e version)

-* Page 244 ... 251 (FMi)
  The vertical lines in the examples (mentioned on this page) are all
missing on the final printout. Another printing problem.

-* Page 250 (MGo)
  section 8.7.6: some space (\thinspace) should be inserted in
  front of the semicolon (;) at the end of formula 8.57 and its
  unnumbered equivalent (fourth line from bottom).

  This is a ovalbox
should be
  This is an ovalbox

     should be
  A tree graph can be drawn

========== Chapter 11 ===========

-* Page 314 (MGo)
  Figure 11.1: some of the dotted vertical and horizontal lines
  indicating the coordinate system are part invisible
  (printing problem)

-* Page 318 (DKu)
  first line of boxed description of \epsfig command,
  rotate=angle,% should be angle=degrees,%

-* Page 321 (MGo)
  Figure 11.5 The vertical lines at the right-hand side of the
  is invisible (printing problem)

-* Page 333 (PHa)
  Footnote in Table 11.6:  ZapfChancery (not ZaptChancery)

-* Page 340 (PHa)
  6th line before the end of 11.9.7: Hyphen missing in AMS-TeX

-* Page 340 (DKra,FMi)
   para 4, line 5: ... (see tables 8.2 to 8.20 beginning in page 218)

-* Page 393, middle of page (KML)
  Utah Univeristy should read Utah University

-* Page 401, 5th line from bottom (SMi}

LaTeX (by making the `driver code' the first docstrip module)

========== Appendix A ===========

-* Page 446 (DCa)
(\stepcounter description)
  oldcr
should be
  oldctr

-* Pages 448 and 449 (MGo)
  All occurrences of the string "\cmd", representing the LaTeX
  lengths parameters should not have the \ (backslash) to
  be compatible with the syntax used in Lamport and the rest
  of the Companion (Lamport assumes that cmd implicitly implies
  the backslash).

-* Page 458, 2 para (MGo)
  innner-pos should be inner-pos

-* Page 459 (DCa, MGo)
You use `cmd' for \sbox, but `\cmd' for lrbox.
Should be 'cmd' throughout to be compatible with Lamport's syntax.

-* Page 461 (FMi)
  Add \ProvidesFile to table.
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{release} should read
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{class}

-* Page 462 (FMi)
  Describe \ProvidesFile. This is like \ProvidesPackage but you need
  to give the full file name including extension. It is meant for
  files that are neither packages nor classes but want to identify
  themselves too.

-* Page 467 (War)
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{release} should read
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{class}

   - CTAN host in Germany has changed to ftp.dante.de
   - correct location of TeX-index file on ftp.dante.de (MGo)

-* Page 479 (MGo) update for Dante
   - their mail server is at ftpmail@dante.de,
   - send a message containing the word "help" to get instructions.

-* Page 480 (EPi,MGo)
   UKTeX gets Chair instead of Chairman
   Group francophone should read Groupe francophone
   Email address for Dante is now dante@dante.de (MGo)

========== Bibliography ===========

-* Pages 482 and following (BBe)
    TUGboat should have a small "b"; occurs about a zillion times in
    both references and text. why don't you just use \TUB for it:
    \def\TUB{{\tubfont TUGboat\/}}

-* Page 482, [11] last line (BBe)
   "bowles" should be "bowls"

-* Page 485, (BBe) [31] last line (BBe)
    "Script Mathematical Formula Processor -- SMFF"
    maybe that should be "SMFP"?, No, it should be (MGo) :+{
    "Script Mathematical Formula Formatter -- SMFF"

-* Page 485, [33]--[35] (BBe)
    omit "Technical Report" from before the ISO numbers.
    the ISO document system also has technical reports, which have "TR"
    in their number designations; these are quite different from the
    standards, which is what is being referred to here.
    also in [35] you should refer to "ISO/IEC 10646, ISO Geneva, 1993."
    this was approved as a formal standard last year, so the "draft" is
    no longer appropriate.  and it's joint with the International
    Electrotechnical Commission, no longer just ISO.

-* Page 486, [37] (BBe)
    publication location is not Stanford, but Bedford, MA.

-* Page 491, [85] (BBe)
    reference should be to ISO/IEC 10646, not "ISO-10656".
    (you can leave out the "iec" in this context, but do fix the number.)

-* Page 492, [88] (BBe)
    not sure where crc press is located, but "Ann Horbor" isn't likely it.
    possibly "Ann Arbor"? Yes, it is (MGo)

-* Page 492, [90] (BBe)
    is there a reason why in "\LaTeX{} Kompaktf"uhrer"
    the latex part is italic and the kompaktf"uhrer is upright?  i'd
    have made both italic, and knowing leslie's predilection about the
    latex logo, ...
-* Page 492, (MGo)
    Add new reference [95]
    George Gr"atzer.
    Math into TeX: A Simple Introduction to AmSLaTeX.
    Birkh"auser, Boston, 1993.
         The first part of the book provides the novice user of
         AmSLaTeX with a simple approach, based on many examples,
         a formula gallery, sample files, and templates.
         The second part contains a systematic discussion with
         detailed examples and rules of all aspects of AmSLaTeX,
         while the final part looks at more advanced customization issues.



========== Index ===========

-* Page 493ff (FMi)
  all font-size functions need to be indexed under their names pointing
to Size-function

  \baselineskip is indexed once as command (not rubber length)

-* Page 501 (LLa)
  The main entry for DOCSTRIP (page 432ff) is missing.

-* Page 508 (PHa,FMi)
  the page range for the entries
           index package  and    Index

  All the page number styles are double printed, eg AlphAlph

-* Page 519 (FPo)
