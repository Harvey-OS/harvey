%  The first set of definitions is what will be in effect outside of cyrillic,
%  i.e., in transliterated text.

%  Definition of \cydot is not ideal; real dot should be in an accent font.
\def\cydot{{\mathsurround=0pt$\cdot$}}

%  \ubar is the definition of \b from PLAIN; it may not work in math mode.
\def\ubar#1{\oalign{#1\crcr\hidewidth
    \vbox to.2ex{\hbox{\char22}\vss}\hidewidth}}

%  Soft and hard signs are represented in transliteration by prime and
%  double prime respectively.
\def\cprime{\/{\mathsurround=0pt$'$}}
\def\Cprime{{\mathsurround=0pt$'$}}
\def\cdprime{\/{\mathsurround=0pt$''$}}
\def\Cdprime{{\mathsurround=0pt$\ubar{\hbox{$''$}}$}}

\def\dbar{dj}           % make real barred d when accent font available
\def\Dbar{Dj}           %  ""

%  It would be nice to make these control sequences unnecessary; that will
%  probably require d to become active.

%  Stress marks are sometimes used in cyrillic text, mainly for pedagogic
%  reasons.  These definitions support stress marks within {\cyr ...};
%  in transliteration, they are suppressed.  Stress is indicated in
%  input by \! preceding a letter on which a stress mark is to appear;
%  an acute accent will appear in the output.  Since \! is also a plain
%  command, for negative thin space in math mode, test for math mode and
%  include the plain definition as appropriate.

%
%  Access to the cyrillic is through the MR 1980 transliteration scheme,
%  using TeX/Metafont ligature capability.  (An alternate set of ligatures
%  exists, for accessing letters beyond the 26 located in the font positions
%  of the 26 roman letters.  An authoritative list of the ligature rules is
%  given below, under the heading Ligatures.)  Successful use of this file
%  requires appropriate cyrillic and accent fonts, arranged according to
%  the AMS/MR scheme.
%
%  There are some weaknesses in this ligaturing and accent system.
%  The following are known to be less than satisfactory:
%
%       the intermediate `ligatures' for shch access numerals;
%       primes (transliteration of hard/soft signs) use math mode;
%       underbar on `cap' double prime is too low (hard sign);
%       thorn d's don't yet exist;
%       \cydot uses math mode;
%       this scheme is not compatible with automatic Russian hyphenation.
%
%
%  Notes on the macros:
%
%       The single space following each hex character code is necessary
%       to prevent the next input character from being gobbled.
%
%
%  Note on \mark :
%
%       Control sequences such as these cyrillic accents should remain
%       unexpanded when generating \mark's; otherwise, the definition of
%       the expanded strings in effect when the \mark is used may be
%       inappropriate.  By \let\...=\relax , the \... takes on the important
%       characteristic of a primitive that it will not be expanded further.
%       The following code has been shown to generate correct \mark entries
%       that can be used successfully in running heads:
%
%       \newtoks\marktoks
%       \def\domark{\keep@cyracc \mark{\the\marktoks}}
%
%       In running heads, the marks should be accessed using \the to expand
%       the tokens strings properly.
