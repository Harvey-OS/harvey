<H1>Mothra Help</H1>
<p>
Mothra is a World-wide Web browser. Its display looks like this:
<p><img src="file:display.pic" alt="[mothra display]">
<p>The display's regions, from top to bottom, are:
<ul>
<li>A display of error messages and other information.
<li>A text input window in which <a href="#commands">commands</a> can be typed.
<li>A scrollable list of titles of previously visited documents, with the most recent first.
Selecting one of these lines with mouse button 1 revisits the document.
<li>The title of the currently-displayed document.
<li>The URL of the currently-displayed document.
<li>The scrollable document display.  Underlined text and
images surrounded by boxes may be selected by button 1 to
visit the files that they refer to.  Files that are not
HTML documents (for example images or mailto: urls) cause
<i>9v</i> or <i>mail</i> to pop up in a new 8Â½ window.
</ul>
<h4>Mouse Action</H4>
<p>Button 3 pops up a command menu.  Pointing with button
2 instead of button 1 selects a url without following
it (for commands that refer to a url.)
Currently, the button 3 menu just contains
<ul>
<li>fix cmap<br>reload the default plan 9 colormap
<li>exit
</ul>
<a name="#commands"><h4>Commands</h4></a>
<p>The commands you can type are:
<ul>
<li>g url<br>get the page with the given url
<li>s file<br>save the current page in the given file
<li>q<br>exit
<li>?<br>get help
<li>h<br>get help
</ul>
<p>
Mothra creates 2 files in $home/lib/mothra.
<ul>
<li>mothra.log<br>a list of all the url's visited
<li>mothra.err<br>a log of error messages,
mostly uninteresting
</ul>
