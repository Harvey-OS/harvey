.SH DESCRIPTION
These primitives control access to shared
resources using spin locks.
They in turn are used to build higher-level synchronisation mechanisms
such as those described in
.IR sleep (9),
.IR qlock (9)
and
.IR qio (9).
They should be used only to protect short critical sections
that update shared data structures.
.PP
.I Lock
loops repeatedly attempting acquire the spin lock
.I l
until it succeeds.
.I Lock
should not be used to lock a structure shared with an interrupt handler
unless interrupts are disabled by
.IR splhi (9)
before attempting the lock;
it is better to use
.IR ilock ,
below.
.PP
.I Canlock
is non-blocking.
Only one attempt is made for the lock.
It returns non-zero if the lock was successfully acquired; 0 otherwise.
.PP
.I Unlock
releases the lock
.IR l .
A lock must be unlocked only by the locking process.
.PP
When called by a process, the functions above temporarily boost its priority
to the highest priority,
.BR PriLock ;
its original priority is restored at the end of the critical section by
.IR unlock .
On a uniprocessor, if
.I l
is unavailable,
.I lock
can reschedule unless interrupts are disabled before entering
.I lock
or there is no current process (eg, when executing the scheduler).
.PP
.I Ilock
disables interrupts before attempting to acquire the lock.
It should be used to lock a resource shared between a process and an interrupt handler.
On a uniprocessor, disabling interrupts is sufficient to exclude an interrupt handler
from the critical section,
and on a multiprocessor the spin lock excludes an interrupt handler running on another processor.
.I Ilock
never reschedules the caller, nor must a caller allow itself to be rescheduled
(eg, by calling
.IR sleep (9))
before releasing the lock.
.PP
.I Iunlock
releases a lock previously got by
.IR ilock .
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The lock functions
guard against the possibility of never acquiring the lock by capping the number of lock attempts.
If the limit is reached, a message of
the following form is written on the console:
.IP
.EX
lock loop on \fIlock-address\fP key \fIkey-value\fP pc \fIcaller-pc\fP held by pc \fIlock-pc\fP
.EE
.PP
Most lock loops represent deadlocks caused by failing to unlock a resource,
attempting to lock (eg, by recursive call) a resource already held by the process,
inconsistent locking and unlocking of nested resources, using a spin-lock
to guard code that reschedules, using
.I lock
not
.I ilock
to interlock with an interrupt routine, and similar blunders.
