.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pcp
copies the input picture (default standard input) to the
output file (default standard output).
Options control the attributes and content of the output picture.
.TP
.BI -w " x0 y0 x1 y1
causes only the given window of the input picture to be copied.
By default the whole picture is copied.
.TP
.BI -o " x y
causes the output picture's
.B WINDOW=
attribute to be translated by adding
.RI ( x , y )
to the input window coordinates.
.TP
.BI -t " type
sets the
.B TYPE=
attribute of the output file.  The default is to use the input
file's type.
.TP
.BI -c " channels
causes only the given channels of the input picture to be copied.
The default is to copy all channels.  If channels not present in
the input picture are specified, they are computed in the ``most
plausible'' way.  For example, a missing
.I alpha
channel is set to 255, and an
.B m
channel will be synthesized from
.B rgb
channels by computing NTSC luminance.  A
.B 0
in
.I channels
causes a zero channel to be written.
.TP
.BI -C " channels
sets the output
.B CHAN=
attribute.
.I Channels
must be the same length as the selected channels of the input picture.
