.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Drop
displays its argument picture file (default standard input) in the middle of a terminal screen
or
.B 8½
window.  As most Plan 9 terminals are grey-scale
devices with only a few bits per pixel, it computes the
luminance of color images and uses error-diffusion
dither to quantize the pixel values.
.I Save
writes a picfile containing its window (or screen if
.B 8½
is not running)
onto its standard output.
.PP
.I Flip
displays many picfiles in sequence in a loop.  The pictures must be
the same size, and must fit in memory.
The pictures are all loaded into main memory and then sent to the display
as required using
.B wrbitmap
(see
.IR balloc (2)),
so the machine running
.I flip
can be remote; a CPU server
can be used if there are many large frames.
The
.B -r
option sets the display rate in frames per second.  By default
.I flip
displays as fast as it can: 
about 15 frames per second for a small picture on a Magnum.
