.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getcmap
retrieves the named colormap and stores it in
.IR map .
Usually
.I name
is the name of a colormap file (see
.IR cmap (9.6))
or a picfile with a
.B CMAP=
attribute.  If the file is not found, it is sought in
.BR /lib/fb/cmap .
.PP
If the
.I file
cannot be found, and its name has the form
.BI gamma number\f1,
a colormap is fabricated with all three channels of its
.IR n th
entry set to
.RI 255Ã—( n /255)\u\s-21/ number\s+2\d .
If the name is just
.BR gamma ,
.IR number =2.3
is assumed.
.PP
There is no
.IR putcmap ,
because
.B write
(in
.IR read (2))
can do the job.
