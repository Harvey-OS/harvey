.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B remove
request asks the file server both to remove the file represented by
.I fid
and to
.B clunk
the
.I fid,
even if the remove fails.
This request will fail if the client does not have write permission
in the parent directory.
.PP
It is correct to consider
.B remove
to be a
.B clunk
with the side effect of removing the file if permissions allow.
.SH ENTRY POINTS
.B Remove
messages are generated by
.I remove.
