.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B clwalk
request is a combination of a
.B clone
request (see
.IR clone (5))
followed by a
.B walk
request (see
.IR walk (5))
on the new
.IR fid .
If the walk fails, there is an implicit
.B clunk
of
.BR newfid .
.SH ENTRY POINTS
The
.B clwalk
message is an optimization for use on low-speed lines; it is not generated
by the kernel.
The
.IR cfs (4)
cached file system generates it as a side-effect of any
system call that interprets a file name.
