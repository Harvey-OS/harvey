.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B clone
request carries as arguments an existing 
.I fid
and a proposed
.I newfid
(which must not be in use)
that the client wishes to associate with
the same file as
.IR fid .
The
.I fid
must be valid in the current session and must not have been opened for I/O
by an
.B open
or
.B create
message.
After a successful
.B clone
and before any subsequent messages,
.I fid
and
.I newfid
are indistinguishable.
.SH ENTRY POINTS
A
.B clone
message is generated by
any system call that evaluates a path name and
by a
.I read
of a union directory.
