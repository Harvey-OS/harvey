.TH XNF 10.1
.SH NAME
xnf \- minterm to xilinx XNF translation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cda/xnf
\fIfile\fP.m
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Xnf
translates input in
.IR minterm (10.6)
format to Xilinx Netlist Format suitable for processing
by the Xilinx minimization, placing routing software.  This
translation is very naive and not guaranteed to be acceptable
by the Xilinx
.I ppr
program for X4000 parts.  In any case, the Xilinx
.I xnfopt
program should be run first.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR lde (10.1)
.SH BUGS
Use
.I xil
and the 4000 series parts instead.
