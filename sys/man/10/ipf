.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Ipf
reads at least an adil_file,
as produced by
.BR "cda/act -a" ,
and a pin_file,
returned by the Actel placing and routing software and produces two files:
package and type definitions in CDL format in
.IB name .pins \fP,
and a new input file for the Actel software in
.IB name .ipf \fP,
where
.I name
is the prefix of the first file argument.
If
.IB name .ipf
were given to the Actel software,
it would return a pin_file with the same contents as the argument to
.IR ipf .
.PP
.I Pga132a
provides pin name to pin number translations for the Actel PGA132 package.
