.TH PART 10.1
.SH NAME
part \- configure common programmable logic devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B part
[
.I options
] [
.I filename
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Part
accepts logic functions described by
.IR minterm (10.6)
as input and attempts to implement them with programmable
logic devices. It assigns pins partitioning them
over multiple devices if necessary.
In the case that a single device is sufficient, part produces two output
files 
.IB filename .m
and
.IB filename .p .
The first is used by
.I xpal (10.1)
for programming the device; the second
contains pin assignment information. In the case of multiple devices
.IB filename . nn m
and
.IB filename . nn p
files are generated, where
.I nn
are integers between 0 and the number of
devices minus one. In the case of multiple devices, a
.IB filename .j
giving a schematic representation of how the devices are connected in
.IR graw (10.1)
format is also produced.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.BI -t " device_type
use
.I device_type
as the target device programmable logic device.
By default,
.I part
uses the type on the
.B .x
line of the
.IR lde_format (10.6)
source file if present.
.TP
.BI -N " n
Iterate at most
.I n
times (default is 5).
.TP
.BI -M " n
Iterate an additional
.I n
times after successfully fitting the equations
to the target devices.
.TP
.B -p
Use the pin assignments in the
pin assignment
files.
