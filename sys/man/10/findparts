.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Findparts
reads the output of
.I getparts
(see
.IR fizz (10.1))
and finds the bin number of each part (or functional equivalent)
in the local stockroom.
.PP
.I Ics
searches the stock list to find the bins for the
.I part
arguments.
The arguments should be the name of a chip, such as
.BR 74F00 .
.PP
.I Pins
searches the standard pins file
to find the pin names of the
.I part
and its relevant pin numbers.
if three arguments are given instead of two, then the second argument is
used as the pin library filename.
.PP
.I Lookup
searches the chip database in one of three modes: 
.B type
searches the database by type, e.g. driver or dsp.  However, certain
names are common (driver is one of them).
Mode
.B index
should be used first to see all the fields for a given chip type.
After filtering the output, then use the "type" option to find
all chips of that type.
Mode
.B chip
looks up all chips with that string, e.g.
.B 2901
will find all
.B 2901
chips.
.SH FILES
.B /n/coma/usr/ucds/lib/stock	stock list
.B /sys/lib/cda/lib.pins	system pin library
.SH BUGS
The equivalence classes known to
.I findparts
are fairly crude.
.PP
The string matches are done exactly with
.IR grep (1);
an inverted index would be better.
.PP
The CAPS database is much better than
.IR lookup ,
but is not on line.
