.SH NAME
fizz \- physical layout input language
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fizz
is a suite of tools to build circuit boards from a circuit description.
This section describes the input format for the various
.I fizz
commands.
Most of the UCDS tools produce files in
.IR cdl (10.6)
format;
these need to be converted into
.I fizz
format by
.IR cvt .
.SS Concepts
Types, signals and chips are identified by name.
Pins are identified by name and number.
A
.I name
is a string of letters,
digits or any of the characters
.BR +-.$/:<=>[]\(ul .
Sometimes, the first character
may not be a digit.
A name may not be longer than 137 characters.
.PP
The physical design
consists of a
.I board
containing
.IR pin-holes .
The description details the positions of the pin-holes and the
position and orientation of the chips.
I/O connectors may be considered as chips with unmoveable packages.
.PP
The coordinate system for the board has
.I x
increasing to the right and
.I y
increasing upwards.
The origin is at the lower left corner;
no coordinate should ever be negative.
The circuit board and components mounted on it are described
as rectangles.
They are positioned so that their sides are parallel to one or other
of the axes.
Measurements are integers measuring 0.001 inch.
Coordinates are expressed as pairs of integers separated by
.B /
with
the
.I x
coordinate appearing first.
All rectangular regions are half open;
the upper and right edges are outside the rectangle.
.SS Syntax
The input is a sequence of items.
An item consists of a item-type followed by a number of fields.
Multiple fields are indicated by a trailing
.B {
on the keyword line and terminated by a line containing a single
.BR } .
Fields are a keyword followed by the value for that field.
Certain values are spread over multiple lines between
.B {}
as described above.
.PP
It is sometimes necessary to provide a list of
coordinates.
Invariably each coordinate is associated with a numbered object
(say, a pin number).
A one coordinate list consists of the index
number followed by its coordinates as in
.RS
.PP
.B
28 1700/2500
.RE
A series of equally spaced
and consecutively numbered coordinates can be described by
giving the first and last coordinates and separating the
two with
.B -
as in
.RS
.PP
.B
28 1700/2500 - 30 1900/2000
.RE
Coordinate 29 is 1800/2250.
If the index numbers are equally spaced but not consecutive
a step size can follow the
.B -
as in
.RS
.PP
.B
12 2000/7000 -9 147 2000/1000
.RE
This describes coordinates numbered 12, 21, 30, and so on.
If a letter follows the coordinate specifications,
it specifies the drill to be used for the pinholes.
The known drill types are
.TS
center, tab(/);
cFCW1 n cFCW1 n cFCW1 n cFCW1 n cFCW1 n cFCW1 n cFCW1 n.

.SS Items
In the following descriptions,
each item has a sample input defining all possible fields.
Some fields are optional; mandatory fields are marked by
.B **
which is
.I not
part of the actual input.
.Cs
Board{
	name board_name
	align 1600/2000 9600/1700 1400/7100 9600/6600
	layer signalside 1
	plane 1 + VCC 2000 2000 8000 8000
	datums 100/100 135 100/8000 45 10000/100 45
}
.Ce
The board name is set to
.I board_name .
The alignment points are used by
.B "wrap -s"
to align the board in Joe's semi-automatic wire wrapping machine.
All four alignment points must be given.
The
.I layer
field associates a layer number with a name to be used in XY artwork output.
The layer numbers
.B 0
and
.B 1
are the two outside layers.
The
.B plane
fields represent signal planes for circuit boards.
The format is
.I "layer sense signame minx miny maxx maxy" .
.I Sense
is a character
meaning add
.RB ( + )
or subtract
.RB ( - )
the rectangle for the signal
.I signame .
The planes can be viewed with
.IR place (10.1).
Note that multiple signals can be present in one layer.
The
.I datums
field sets the positions and orientations of the three datums
(alignment marks for artwork).
The orientation is the angle formed by the two squares in the datum.
.Cs
Package{
**	name DIP20
**	br -600 0 9600 3000
**	pins 1 20{
		1 0/0 - 10 9000/0 V
		11 9000/3000 - 20 0/3000 V
	}
	drills 1 2{
		1 500/1500 - 2 8500/1500 V
	}
	keepout 0 - VCC -1000 -4000 10000 3400
	plane 0 - VCC -1000 -4000 10000 3400
	plane 0 + VDD -500 -3500 9500 2900
	xymask clump {
		arbitrary XY mask stuff
	}
}
.Ce
Each package definition may have an arbitrary origin.
The bounding rectangle
.B br
is used for placement;
the values are ll.x, ll.y, ur.x, ur.y.
The
.B drills
field is for mounting bolts etc;
it does not affect placement.
Both the
.B pins
and
.B drills
fields take a minimum and maximum pin number.
Placement of a package involves both its pins and rectangle.
The rectangle must not intersect any other placed package,
and there must be a pin-hole for each of the pins.
The
.B keepout
field looks like a plane definition (the sense is always set to
.BR - ).
Multiwire wiring will not enter the specified plane.
The
.B plane
fields are similar to those in
.B Board
but are instantiated for every chip using this package.
The
.B xymask
field denotes the clump name
.RI ( clump )
for this package and some optional XY mask input
(used by
.IR artwork ).
The XY mask input has leading tabs deleted, not white space, as blanks
are significant to XY mask.
.Cs
Chip{
**	name miscinv
**	type 74F240
}
.Ce
This simply specifies the chip type.
.Cs
Type{
**	name 74F240
**	pkg DIP20
**	family F
	tt ii3i3i3i3gi3i3i3i3iv
}
.Ce
The
.B tt
field must have a letter for every pin of the package.
Any pin whose letter is one of
.B gvwxyz
or
.B GVWXYZ
will be automatically attached to special signal 0,1,2,3,4,5 respectively.
Other letters are ignored (they are used by other tools).
.Cs
Net port 4{
	select 8
	miscinv 14
	syncff 13
	ackff 1
}
.Ce
Signal nets have the net name and number of points on the item line.
All other lines are simple
.I chipname , pinnumber
pairs.
Net descriptions are normally produced by
.IR cvt .
.Cs
Route{
**	name port
**	alg hand
	route{
		ackff 1
		miscinv 14
		select 8
		syncff 13
	}
	layout{
		100/2000 A
		3450/2000 Z
		3400/2000 A
		3400/1000
	}
}
.Ce
This describes the routing for net
.I name .
The algorithm must be one of
.B tsp
(normal travelling salesman),
.B tspe
(travelling salesman specifying one end),
.B mst
(minimal spanning tree),
.B mst3
(minimal spanning tree of degree three),
.B default
(whatever is specified in the
.I wrap
command)
and
.B hand
(the exact order is given).
The routing is a list of
.IR chipname , pinnumber
pairs.
The layout is a list of pin positions.
The layout uses the drill field to specify both the width of the trace
and as a control.
The layout is actually a sequence of lists of connected segments; a pin with a drill of
.B Z
is the last pin in a particular list.
The trace width for a list is taken from the drill of the first pin for that list.
The above example describes a T-shaped layout.
.Cs
Positions{
	select 3200/2300 0 0
	miscinv 4900/1700 0 0
	syncff 2400/2700 0 0
}
.Ce
Specify the position data for each chip.
Each line has the form
.I "chipname coord orientation flags" .
The orientation is the number of right angles clockwise to
rotate the package.
The following bits in
.IR flags ,
which should be initialised to zero,
have a defined meaning:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B 4
this chip is unplaced
.TP
.B 8
the bounding rectangle is ignored in placement
.TP
.B 16
the pinholes are ignored in placement.
.TP
.B 32
the names are ignored in the silk screen output.

Pinholes{
	1400/6900 3200 300 10 V
	6650/6900 3200 300 10 V
	1600/1700 8100 1000 10/30 V
	1600/2700 8100 1000 10/30 V
}
.Ce
Each pinhole specification has the form
.I "coord lx ly spacing diam"
which defines a rectangular array of pin-holes with diameter of
.IR diam .
The lower left corner of the rectangle is
.IR coord ,
and the width and height are
.I lx,ly
respectively.
The pins are placed
.I spacing
apart.
If
.I spacing
is of the form
.IR sx / sy ,
the spacings in the
.I x
and
.I y
directions are set independently.
.Cs
Vsig 0{
	name GND
	pins 96{
		1 1800/2100 - 16 9300/2100 A
		17 1800/3100 - 32 9300/3100 A
		33 1800/4100 - 48 9300/4100 A
		49 1800/5100 - 64 9300/5100 A

		81 1800/6700 - 96 9300/6700 A
	}
}
.Ce
This defines the special signals.
The special signal number follows
.BR Vsig .
Pins are numbered from 1;
the number of pins is given in the
.B pins
field line.
A warning is given if any pins are not specified.
.Cs
Wires {
	level COMP
	net iod15  {
		8100/8500
		8100/8550
		8000/8650
	}
.Ce
Wires specify the inflection points of a signal net.
Each instance of a net creates a new
.IR wire .
The level can also be specified, although it is ignored by the
.I fizz
tools.
