.TH UROM 10.1
.SH NAME
urom \- read and write programmable devices through DATA I/O Unisite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B urom
[
.I option
] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Urom
serves as an interface to the DATA I/O
Unisite\(tm programmer.
Options are used to specify the device type, and whether the device
is to be read or written.
.TP
.B -w
Specifies that the device is to be written; default is read.
.TP
.BI -s n
Specifies a starting address (default 0) in the device in decimal.
.TP
.BI -t string
.br
.ns
.TP
.I string
Specifies the device type of the device.  If it is an ambiguous name, all the
possible conflicts are listed.
.TP
.BI -m string
.br
.ns
.TP
.I string
Specifies the manufacturer of the device; this must be specified
.I before
the type (-t) of the device.  Only needed if the name is ambiguous.
.TP
.BI -n
Causes the program to echo the code that it is sending to
the DATA I/O, and causes the DATA I/O the echo the size and initial state
specified by the code.
No reading or writing is done.
.TP
.BI -b
Causes a blank check to be run, the illegal bit
test is run unless it is an electrically alterable rom.
No blank check is done if the rom is being read.
.TP
.BI -X
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI -x
Specifies hexadecimal data with upper case or lower case respectively.
.TP
.BI -C
Specifies character data, for logic devices with JEDEC format.
.TP
.BI -D
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI -d
Specifies decimal data, octal is default.
.TP
.BI -O
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI -o
Specifies octal data, which is the default.
.TP
.BI -fn
Use format \fIn 50\fP, the default, is for hex, octal, or decimal format files.
91 is for JEDEC files.
.TP
.BI -I string
inhibits checking of following character string, e.g. `-I C' inhibits continuity
checking.
.TP
.BI -J
JEDEC format (same as -f91 -C option)
.TP
.BI -i 
Causes the data to be (ones) complemented on input and output.
.TP
.BI -v
Normally
.I urom
does it work silently, this is the verbose flag.
.PP
To read an Intel 2716 device one could say
.IP
.B
urom -m Intel -t 2716 < filename
.PP
or to write a National PAL16L8
one could say
.IP
.B
urom -w -m National -t 16L8/A/A2 < filename
.PP
The input for logic devices on the Unisite must be in JEDEC
format. In this case use
.IP
.B
urom -w -m National -t 16L8/A/A2 -f 91 -C < filename
.PP
or
.IP
.B
urom -w -m National -t 16L8/A/A2 -J < filename
.PP
When a device is read, the addressed locations are copied,
one per line, onto the standard output.
When a device is written, the standard input is assumed to be
of the same form, and is copied onto the device.
Various Unisite errors, such as the device having a pattern
that conflicts with the data (illegal bit test)
when being written, are reflected back to the user.
Transmissions over the RS-232 line are checksummed,
and when writing the device is verified.
.PP
The speed of the Unisite should be set to 9600,
position 14.
