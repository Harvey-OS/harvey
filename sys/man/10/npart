.TH NPART 10.1
.SH NAME
npart \- configure multi-bank programmable logic devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B npart
[
.I options
] [
.I filename
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Npart
accepts logic functions described by
.IR minterm (10.6)
as input and attempts to implement them with multi-bank programmable
logic devices such as the AMD MACH series parts. It assigns pins and
routes the interconnection switch matrix.
Npart produces two output
files 
.IB filename .m
and
.IB filename .p .
The first is used by
.I xpal (10.1)
for programming the device; the second
contains pin assignment information.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.BI -t " device_type
use
.I device_type
as the target device programmable logic device (presently AMD MACH M110, M120, M130, M210, M220, and M230).
By default,
.I npart
uses the type on the
.B .x
line of the
.IR lde_format (10.6)
source file if present.
.TP
.BI -N " n
Iterate at most
.I n
times (default is 5).
.TP
.BI -M " n
Iterate an additional
.I n
times after successfully fitting the equations
to the target devices to further reduce the interconnection wiring.
.TP
.B -p
Use the pin assignments in the
pin assignment
files.
.TP
.B -L n
Backtrack n levels deep in attempting to route the interconnection switch
matrix (default is 2).
.TP
.B -S n
Leave at least n unused inputs on each of the internal banks.
