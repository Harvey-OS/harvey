.SH NAME
pga \- generate CDL pins format for large packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cda/pga
.I pin_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Pga
takes a list of pin names (in numerical order),
one per line, and generates a pin list
suitable for
.IR cdmglob (10.1)
and friends.  Each pin name may be optionally followed by a
tab and a single character
.IR smoke (10.1)
pin type.  Special pin names are:
.BR VCC ,
.BR VDD ,
.B VSS
and
.BR GND .
These are recognized and generate the proper pin type.  Unless
specified, the default pin type is
.BR 4 ,
or bidirectional tri-state.
.PP
There are two other special names:
.BR NC ,
which denotes no connect pins and
.BR -- ,
which specifies a hole in the PGA.  Comments may
be preceded by a '# '.  Special commands (preceded by a '! ')
worth knowing about are:
.IR debug ,
.IR map ,
.IR clip ,
and
.IR holes .
.PP
.B debug
is useful for double checking your definition,
.PP
.B "map mapfile"
maps the pins via a map file; a map file is a 1:1 mapping suitable for
PGA adaptors.  An example of a map file that will reverse all the pins
in a mysterious 5 pin package is:
.sp
.nf
1	5
2	4
3	3
4	2
5	1
.fi
.PP
.B "clip [v|g]"
tells
.I pga
to capitalize the appropriate plane (suitable for
.IR clip ).
.PP
.B holes
counts holes (pins declared as
.BR -- )
as pins and therefore will generate more pins.  Normally holes are ignored.
