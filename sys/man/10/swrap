.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Swrap
controls a semi-automatic wiring machine as directed by a
.B .wr
file generated by
.IR wrap (10.1).
.PP
Options are:
.nr x \w'-fMname'
.TP \nxu
.BI -f name
Use the file
.I name
instead of
.B /dev/eia0
to control the machine.
.TP
.BI -d mn
The two-character string
.I mn
sets the preferred direction for wire routing.
.I M
gives the first preference and
.I n
the second, according to the following code:
.RS
.TP
.B 0
route from left to right (increasing X).
.TP
.B 1
route from bottom to top (increasing Y).
.TP
.B 2
route from right to left (decreasing X).
.TP
.B 3
route from top to bottom (decreasing Y).
.RE
.TP
.B -l
Produce a listing as a reference for the
machine operator; it describes the wires in the sequence
in which they are to be installed.
.TP
.BI -r d
The digit
.I d
specifies how the board must be rotated from the
position implied by the Circuit Design Language definition of the board.
The rotation is the number of right-angles by which it is to be rotated
anti-clockwise, plus four if the board is first to be flipped over
(X and Y coordinates interchanged).
The initial rotation is given in the board definition.
.TP
.B -v
Set verbose mode.
.PP
Unless a listing is requested, the
on-line Standard Logic wire-wrap machine must be connected to
the designated RS-232 port.
The operator will first be required to calibrate the machine
by moving the pointer to specified pin positions.
Then the machine will point at successive pins which must be wired.
The typed commands to which the program responds are as follows.
.TP
.B udlr
Move the pointer a small distance up, down, left or right.
If preceded by a number scale the distance moved accordingly.
.TP
.BI s\| n
Skip to wire number
.I n.
.TP
.B c
Check the calibration by moving the pointer to the reference pin.
.TP
.SM
.B C
Check positions of all four corner pins of the board.
.TP
.B v
Change to and from verbose mode.
.TP
.B q
Quit after moving the pointer back to the reference pin.
.TP
.B ?
Print details about the wire currently being installed.
