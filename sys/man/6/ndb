.SH NAME
ndb \- Network database
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The network database consists of files
describing machines known to the local
installation and machines known publicly.
The files comprise multi-line tuples made up of
attribute/value pairs of the form
.IB attr = value
or sometimes just
.IR attr .
Each line starting without white space starts a new tuple.
Lines starting with
.B #
are comments.
.PP
The file
.B /lib/ndb/local
is the root of the database.
Other files are included in the
database if a tuple with an
attribute-value pair of attribute
.B database
and no value exists in
.BR /lib/ndb/local .
Within the
.B database
tuple,
each tuple with attribute
.B file
identifies a file to be included in the database.  The files are searched
in the order they appear.
For example:
.IP
.EX
database=
	file=/lib/ndb/common
	file=/lib/ndb/local
	file=/lib/ndb/global
.EE
.PP
declares the database to be composed of the three files
.BR /lib/ndb/common ,
.BR /lib/ndb/local ,
and 
.BR /lib/ndb/global .
By default,
.B /lib/ndb/local
is searched before the others.
However,
.B /lib/ndb/local
may be included in the
.B database
to redefine its ordering.
.PP
Within tuples, pairs on the same line bind tighter than
pairs on different lines.
.PP
The program
.B ndb/cs
(see
.IR ndb (8))
and the library routine
.B ipinfo
(see
.IR ndb (2))
perform searches for information relative to a particular host.
.BR Ndb/cs
resolves meta-addresses of the form
.BI $ attribute
by returning the
.I value
from the
.IB attribute = value
most closely related to the resolving host.
The attribute-value pair comes from the tuple for the system, its subnet, or its network
with the system tuple having precedence, subnet next, and network last.
.PP
A number of attributes are meaningful to programs and thus
reserved.
They are:
.TF restricted
.TP
.B sys
system name
.TP
.B dom
Internet domain name
.TP
.B ip
Internet address
.TP
.B ether
Ethernet address
.TP
.B dk 
Datakit address
.TP
.B bootf
file to download for initial bootstrap
.TP
.B ipnet
Internet network name
.TP
.B ipmask
Internet network mask
.TP
.B ipgw
Internet gateway
.TP
.B auth
authentication server to be used
.TP
.B fs
file server to be used
.TP
.B tcp
a TCP service name
.TP
.B udp
a UDP service name
.TP
.B il
an IL service name
.TP
.B port
a TCP, UDP, or IL port number
.TP
.B restricted
a TCP service that can be called only by ports numbered
less that 1024
.TP
.B proto
a protocol supported by a host.
The pair
.B proto=il
is needed by
.I cs
(see
.IR ndb (8))
in tuples for hosts that support the IL protocol.
.TP
.B 9P
parameters for the 9P file protocol, in particular whether the server authenticates
.RB ( 9P=auth ).
.sp
.PP
The file
.B /lib/ndb/auth
is used during authentication to decide who has the power to `speak for' other
users; see
.IR auth (6).
