.TH NDB 6
.SH NAME
ndb \- Network database
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The network database consists of files
describing machines known to the local
installation and machines known publicly.
The files comprise multi-line tuples made up of
attribute/value pairs of the form
.IB attr = value
or sometimes just
.IR attr .
Each line starting without white space starts a new tuple.
Lines starting with
.B #
are comments.
.PP
The file
.B /lib/ndb/local
is the root of the database.
Other files are included in the
database if a tuple with an
attribute-value pair of attribute
.B database
and no value exists in
.BR /lib/ndb/local .
Within the
.B database
tuple,
each pair with attribute
.B file
identifies a file to be included in the database.  The files are searched
in the order they appear.
For example:
.IP
.EX
database=
	file=/lib/ndb/common
	file=/lib/ndb/local
	file=/lib/ndb/global
.EE
.PP
declares the database to be composed of the three files
.BR /lib/ndb/common ,
.BR /lib/ndb/local ,
and 
.BR /lib/ndb/global .
By default,
.B /lib/ndb/local
is searched before the others.
However,
.B /lib/ndb/local
may be included in the
.B database
to redefine its ordering.
.PP
Within tuples, pairs on the same line bind tighter than
pairs on different lines.
.PP
Programs search the database directly using the routines in
.IR ndb (2)
or indirectly using
.B ndb/cs
and
.B ndb/dns
(see
.IR ndb (8)).
Both
.B ndb/cs
and the routine
.I ndbipinfo
impose structure on the otherwise flat database by using
knowledge specific to the network.
The internet is made up of networks which can be subnetted
multiple times.  A network must have an
.B ipnet
attribute and is uniquely identified by the values of it's
.B ip
and
.B ipmask
attributes.  If the
.B ipmask
is missing, the relevant Class A, B or C one is used.
The network is subnetted if one or more
.BR ipsubmask 's
are specified.
A search for an attribute associated with a network or host starts
at the top-level Class A, B, or C network and works it's way down to the
specific entry.  The attribute/value chosen is the one lowest down in the
search, i.e, closest to the host.
For example, consider at the following entries:
.IP
.EX
ipnet=murray-hill ip=135.104.0.0 ipmask=255.255.0.0
	ipsubmask=255.255.255.0
	dns=135.104.10.1
	ntp=ntp.cs.bell-labs.com
ipnet=plan9 ip=135.104.9.0 ipmask=255.255.255.0
	ntp=oncore.cs.bell-labs.com
	smtp=smtp1.cs.bell-labs.com
ip=135.104.9.6 sys=anna dom=anna.cs.bell-labs.com
	smtp=smtp2.cs.bell-labs.com
.EE
.LP
Here
.B anna
is on the subnet
.B plan9
which is in turn on the class B net
.BR murray-hill .
If one were to search for
.BR anna 's
.B NTP
and
.B SMTP
servers, one would get
.B oncore.cs.bell-labs.com
and
.B smtp2.cs.bell-labs.com
respectively.
.PP
.I Ndb/cs
can be made to perform such network aware
searches by using metanames in the dialstring.
A metaname is a
.I $
followed by an attribute name.
.I Ndb/cs
looks up the attribute relative to the system it is running
on.  Thus, with the above example, if a program called
.IP
.EX
	dial("tcp!$smtp!smtp", 0, 0, 0);
.EE
.LP
the dial would connect to the SMTP port of
.BR smtp2.cs.bell-labs.com .
.PP
A number of attributes are meaningful to programs and thus
reserved.
They are:
.TF restricted
.TP
.B sys
system name
.TP
.B dom
Internet domain name
.TP
.B ip
Internet address
.TP
.B ether
Ethernet address
.TP
.B bootf
file to download for initial bootstrap
.TP
.B ipnet
Internet network name
.TP
.B ipmask
Internet network mask
.TP
.B ipsubmask
Internet network mask of this network's subnets
.TP
.B ipgw
Internet gateway
.TP
.B auth

.TP
.B fs
file server to be used
.TP
.B tcp
a TCP service name
.TP
.B udp
a UDP service name
.TP
.B il
an IL service name
.TP
.B port
a TCP, UDP, or IL port number
.TP
.B restricted
a TCP service that can be called only by ports numbered
less that 1024
.TP
.B proto
a protocol supported by a host.
The pair
.B proto=il
is needed by
.I cs
(see
.IR ndb (8))
in tuples for hosts that support the IL protocol
.TP
.B dnsdomain
a domain name that
.I ndb/dns
adds onto any unrooted names when doing a search
There may be multiple
.B dnsdomain
pairs.
.TP
.B dns
a DNS server to use (for DNS and DHCP)
.TP
.B ntp
an NTP server to use (for DHCP)
.TP
.B smtp
an SMTP server to use (for DHCP)
.TP
.B time

.TP
.B mx

.TP
.B soa
start of area (for DNS)
.sp
.PD
.PP
The file
.B /lib/ndb/auth
is used during authentication to decide who has the power to `speak for' other
users; see
.IR authsrv (6).
