.TH USERS 6
.SH NAME
users \- file server user list format
.SH DESCRIPTION
The permanent file servers each maintain a private list of users
and groups, in
.B /adm/users
by convention.
Each line in the file has the format
.IP
.IR num : name : leader :\fImembers\fP
.PP
where
.I num
is a decimal integer,
.I name
and
.I leader
are printable strings excluding the characters
.LR ? ,
.LR = ,
.LR + ,
.LR - ,
.LR / ,
and
.LR : ,
and
.I members
is a comma-separated list of such strings.
Such a line defines a user and a group with the given
.IR name ;
the group has a group leader given by
.I leader
and group members given by the user names in
.IR members .
The
.I leader
field may be empty,
in which case any group member is a group leader.
The
.I members
field may be empty.
.PP
Lines beginning with
.L #
are ignored.
.PP
The
.I num
in a line is a number used internally by a file server;
there should be no duplicate
.IR num s
in the file.
A negative
.I num
is special: a user with a negative
.I num
cannot attach to the file server.
The file
.B /adm/users
itself is owned by user
.IR adm ,
having a negative
.IR num ,
so it can only be changed via console commands.
