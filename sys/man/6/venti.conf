.SH NAME
venti.conf  \- a venti configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
A venti configuration file enumerates the various index sections and
arenas that constitute a venti system.
The components are indicated by the name of the file, typically
a disk partition, in which they reside.  The configuration
file is the only location that file names are used.  Internally,
venti uses the names assigned when the components were formatted
with 
.IR fmtarenas (8)
or 
.IR fmtisect (8).
In particular, by changing the configuration a
component can be copied to a different file.
.PP
The configuration file consists of lines in the form described below.
Lines starting with
.B #
are comments.
.TP

.IR fmtarenas (8).
.TP

After formatting a venti system using
.IR fmtindex (8),
the order of arenas and index sections should not be changed.
Additional arenas can be appended to the configuration.
