.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Read
reads
.I nbytes
bytes of data
from the offset in the file associated with
.I fd
into memory at
.IR buf .
The offset is advanced by the number of bytes read.
It is not guaranteed
that all
.I nbytes
bytes will be read; for example
if the file refers to the console, at most one line
will be returned.
In any event the number of bytes read is returned.
A return value of
0 is conventionally interpreted as end of file.
.PP
.I Readn
is just like read, but does successive
.I read
calls until
.I nbytes
have been read, or a read system call
returns a non-positive count.
.PP
.I Write
writes
.I nbytes
bytes of data starting at
.I buf
to the file associated with
.I fd
at the file offset.
The offset is advanced by the number of bytes written.
The number of characters actually written is returned.
It should be regarded as an error
if this is not the same as requested.
.PP
.I Pread
and
.I Pwrite
equivalent to a
.IR seek (2)
to
.I offset
followed by a
.I read
or
.IR write .
By combining the operations in a single atomic call, they more closely
match the 9P protocol
(see
.IR intro (5))
and, more important,
permit multiprocess programs to execute multiple concurrent
read and write operations on the same file descriptor
without interference.
.PP
.I Read9p
and
.I write9p
are like read and write and are used when reading/writing
.B 9P
messages to/from a remote file, for example
.BR /mnt/term/srv/boot .
9P limits the size of the data in a read or write
message, normally 8192 bytes.
When encapsulating a 9P write request or read reply inside another 9P
message that limit must be relaxed to make room for the extra header.
.I Read9p
and
.I write9p
are kludges to allow that relaxation.  Using these calls, one
can encapsulate 9P messages up to 8 levels deep.
