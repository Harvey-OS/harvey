int pushssl(int fd, char *alg, char *secin, char *secout, int *cfd)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pushssl
opens an
.IR ssl (3)
device, connects it to the communications channel
.IR fd ,
and starts up encryption and message authentication as specified
in
.IR alg .
The algorithms are separated by a space and either can be first.
See
.IR ssl (3)
for the possible algorithms.
.I Secin
and
.I secout
contain the encryption keys for the two directions.
If either is nil, the other is used in both directions.
If
.I cfd
is non-nil, the SSL control channel is opened and its fd
returned.
.PP
.I Pushssl
returns a file descriptor for the SSL data channel.  Anything written to this
descriptor will get encrypted and authenticated and then written to the
file descriptor,
.IR fd .
