.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sleep
suspends the current process for the number
of milliseconds specified by the argument.
The actual suspension time may be a little more or less than
the requested time. A sleep of 0 causes the process to
give up the CPU if another process is ready to run.
Sleep returns \-1 if interrupted, 0 otherwise.
.PP
.I Alarm
causes an
.B "alarm"
note (see
.IR notify (2))
to be sent to the invoking process after the number of milliseconds
given by the argument.
Successive calls to
.I alarm
reset the alarm clock.
A zero argument clears the alarm.
The return value is the amount of time previously remaining in
the alarm clock.
