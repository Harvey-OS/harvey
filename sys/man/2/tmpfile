.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tmpfile
creates a temporary file that will automatically
be removed when the file is closed or the program exits.
The return value is a stdio
.B FILE*
opened in update mode (see
.IR fopen (2)).
.PP
.I Tmpnam
generates a string that is a valid file name and that is not
the same as the name of an existing file.
If
.I s
is zero, it returns a pointer to a string which may be overwritten by
subsequent calls to
.IR tmpnam .
If
.I s
is non-zero, it should point to an array of at least
.B L_tmpnam
(defined in
.BR <stdio.h> )
characters, and the answer will be copied there.

are not removed until

is executed; in particular, they are not removed on
.I fclose
or if the program terminates abnormally.
