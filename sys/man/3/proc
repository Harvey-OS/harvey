.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I proc
device serves a two-level directory structure.
The first level contains numbered directories
corresponding to pids of live processes;
each such directory contains a set of files
representing the corresponding process.
.PP
The
.B mem
file contains the current memory image of the process.
A read or write at offset
.IR o ,
which must be a valid virtual address,
accesses bytes from address
.IR o
up to the end of the memory segment containing
.IR o .
Kernel virtual memory, including the kernel stack for the process and
saved user registers (whose addresses are machine-dependent),
can be accessed through
.BR mem .
Writes are permitted only while the process is in the
.B Stopped
state and only to user addresses or registers.
.PP
The read-only
.B proc
file contains the kernel per-process
structure.
Its main use is to recover the kernel stack and program counter
for kernel debugging.
.PP
The read-only
.B segment
file contains a textual display of the memory segments
attached to the process.  Each line has multiple fields:
the type of segment (\c
.BR Stack ,
.BR Text ,
.BR Data ,
.BR Bss ,
etc.); one-letter flags such as
.B R
for read-only, if any;
starting virtual address, in hexadecimal;
ending virtual address, and reference count.
.PP
The read-only
.B status
file contains a string with eight fields, each followed by a space.
The fields are: the process name and user name, each 27 characters left justified;
the process state, 11 characters left justified (see
.IR ps (1));
the six 11-character numbers also held in the process's
.B #c/cputime
file,
and the amount of memory used by the process, except its stack,
in units of 1024 bytes.
.PP
The
.B text
file is a pseudonym for the file
from which the process was executed;
its main use is to recover the symbol table of the process.
.PP
The
.B wait
file may be read to recover
.B Waitmsg
records from the exiting children of the process.
If the process has no extant children, living or exited,
a read of
.B wait
will block.
It is an error for a process to attempt to read its own
.B wait
file when it has no children.
When a process's
.B wait
file is being read,
the process will draw an error
if it attempts a
.B wait
system call; similarly, if a process is in a
.B wait
system call, its
.B wait
file cannot be read by any process.
.PP
Textual messages written to the
.B ctl
file control the execution of the process.
Some require that the process is in a particular state
and return an error if it is not.
.TP 10n
.B stop
Suspend execution of the process, putting it in the
.B Stopped
state.
.TP 10n
.B start
Resume execution of a
.B Stopped
process.
.TP 10n
.B waitstop
Do not affect the process directly but, like all other messages ending with
.BR stop ,
block the process writing the
.B ctl
file until the target process is in the
.B Stopped
state or exits.
Also like other
.B stop
control messages,
if the target process would receive a note while the message is pending,
it is instead stopped and the debugging process is resumed.
.TP 10n
.B startstop
Allow a
.B Stopped
process to resume, and then do a
.B waitstop
action.
.TP 10n
.B hang
Set a bit in the process so that,
when it completes an
.IR exec (2)
system call, it will enter the
.B Stopped
state before returning to user mode.
This bit is inherited across a
.IR fork (2).
.TP 10n
.B nohang
Clear the hang bit.
.TP 10n
.B kill
Kill the process the next time it crosses the user/kernel boundary.
.PP
Strings written to the
.B note
file will be posted as a note to the process
(see
.IR notify (2)).
The note should be less than
.L ERRLEN-1
characters long;
the last character is reserved for a terminating NUL character.
A read of at least
.L ERRLEN
characters will retrieve the oldest note posted to the
process and prevent its delivery to the process.
The
.B notepg
file is similar, but the note will be delivered to all the
processes in the target process's
.I note group
(see
.IR fork (2)).
However, if the process doing the write is in the group,
it will not receive the note.
The
.B notepg
file is write-only.
.PP
The textual
.B noteid
file may be read to recover an integer identifying the note group of the process
(see
.B RFNOTEG
in
.IR fork (2)).
The file may be written to cause the process to change to another note group,
provided the group exists and is owned by the same user.
