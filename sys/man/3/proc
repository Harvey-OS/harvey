.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I proc
device serves a two-level directory structure.
The first level contains numbered directories
corresponding to pids of live processes;
each such directory contains a set of files
representing the corresponding process.
.PP
The
.B mem
file contains the current memory image of the process.
A read or write at offset
.IR o ,
which must be a valid virtual address,
accesses bytes from address
.IR o
up to the end of the memory segment containing
.IR o .
Kernel virtual memory, including the kernel stack for the process and
saved user registers (whose addresses are machine-dependent),
can be accessed through
.BR mem .
Writes are permitted only while the process is in the
.B Stopped
state and only to user addresses or registers.
.PP
The read-only
.B proc
file contains the kernel per-process
structure.
Its main use is to recover the kernel stack and program counter
for kernel debugging.
.PP
The files
.BR regs ,
.BR fpregs ,
and
.BR kregs
hold representations of the user-level registers, floating-point registers,
and kernel registers in machine-dependent form.
The
.B kregs
file is read-only.
.PP
The read-only
.B fd
file lists the open file descriptors of the process.
The first line of the file is its current directory; subsequent lines list, one per line,
the open files, giving the decimal file descriptor number; whether the file is open for read
.RB ( r ),
write,
.RB ( w ),
or both
.RB ( rw );
the type, device number, and qid of the file; its I/O unit (the amount of data
that may be transferred on the file as a contiguous piece; see
.IR iounit (2)),
its I/O offset; and its name at the time it was opened.
.PP
The read-only
.B ns
file contains a textual representation of the process's file name space, in the format of
.IR namespace (6)
accepted by
.B newns
(see
.IR auth (2)).
The last line of the file identifies the current working directory of the process, in the form of a
.B cd
command
(see
.IR rc (1)).
The information in this file is based on the names files had when the name space was assembled,
so the names it contains may be inaccessible if the files have been subsequently renamed or rearranged.
.PP
The read-only
.B segment
file contains a textual display of the memory segments
attached to the process.  Each line has multiple fields:
the type of segment (\c
.BR Stack ,
.BR Text ,
.BR Data ,
.BR Bss ,
etc.); one-letter flags such as
.B R
for read-only, if any;
starting virtual address, in hexadecimal;
ending virtual address, and reference count.
.PP
The read-only
.B status
file contains a string with twelve fields, each followed by a space.
The fields are:
.IP \-
the process name and user name, each 27 characters left justified
.IP \-
the process state, 11 characters left justified (see
.IR ps (1))
.IP \-
the six 11-character numbers also held in the process's
.B #c/cputime
file
.IP \-
the amount of memory used by the process, except its stack,
in units of 1024 bytes
.IP \-
the base and current scheduling priority, each 11 character numbers
.PP
The read-only
.B args
file contains the arguments of the program when it was created by
.IR exec (2).
If the program was not created by
.BR exec ,
such as by
.IR fork (2),
its
.B args
file will be empty.
The format of the file is a list of quoted strings suitable for
.BR tokenize ;
see
.IR getfields (2).
.PP
The
.B text
file is a pseudonym for the file
from which the process was executed;
its main use is to recover the symbol table of the process.
.PP
The
.B wait
file may be read to recover
records from the exiting children of the process in the format of
.B await
(see
.IR wait (2)).
If the process has no extant children, living or exited,
a read of
.B wait
will block.
It is an error for a process to attempt to read its own
.B wait
file when it has no children.
When a process's
.B wait
file is being read,
the process will draw an error
if it attempts an
.B await
system call; similarly, if a process is in an
.B await
system call, its
.B wait
file cannot be read by any process.
.PP
Textual messages written to the
.B ctl
file control the execution of the process.
Some require that the process is in a particular state
and return an error if it is not.
.TP 10n
.B stop
Suspend execution of the process, putting it in the
.B Stopped
state.
.TP 10n
.B start
Resume execution of a
.B Stopped
process.
.TP 10n
.B waitstop
Do not affect the process directly but, like all other messages ending with
.BR stop ,
block the process writing the
.B ctl
file until the target process is in the
.B Stopped
state or exits.
Also like other
.B stop
control messages,
if the target process would receive a note while the message is pending,
it is instead stopped and the debugging process is resumed.
.TP 10n
.B startstop
Allow a
.B Stopped
process to resume, and then do a
.B waitstop
action.
.TP 10n
.B hang
Set a bit in the process so that,
when it completes an
.IR exec (2)
system call, it will enter the
.B Stopped
state before returning to user mode.
This bit is inherited across
.IR fork (2)
and
.IR exec (2).
.TP 10n
.B "close\ \fIn
Close file descriptor
.I n
in the process.
.TP 10n
.B closefiles
Close all open file descriptors in the process.
.TP 10n
.B nohang
Clear the hang bit.
.TP 10n
.B kill
Kill the process the next time it crosses the user/kernel boundary.
.TP 10n
.B private
Make it impossible to read the process's user memory.
This property is inherited on fork, cleared on
.IR exec (2),
and is not otherwise resettable.
.TP 10n
.B "pri\ \fIn
Set the base priority for the process to the integer
.IR n .
.TP 10n
.B "wire\ \fIn
Wire the process to processor
.IR n .
.PD
.PP
The priority is interpreted by Plan 9's multilevel process scheduler.
Priorities run from 0 to 19, with higher
numbers representing higher priorities.
A process has a base priority and
a running priority which is less than or equal to the base priority.
As a process uses up more of its allocated time, its priority is lowered.
Unless
explicitly set, user processes have base priority 10, kernel processes
13.
Children inherit the parent's base priority.
.PP
The read-only
.B profile
file contains the instruction frequency count information used for multiprocess profiling; see
.B tprof
in
.IR prof (1).
The information is gleaned by sampling the program's user-level program counter
at interrupt time.
.PP
Strings written to the
.B note
file will be posted as a note to the process
(see
.IR notify (2)).
The note should be less than
.B ERRLEN-1
characters long;
the last character is reserved for a terminating NUL character.
A read of at least
.B ERRLEN
characters will retrieve the oldest note posted to the
process and prevent its delivery to the process.
The
.B notepg
file is similar, but the note will be delivered to all the
processes in the target process's
.I note group
(see
.IR fork (2)).
However, if the process doing the write is in the group,
it will not receive the note.
The
.B notepg
file is write-only.
.PP
The textual
.B noteid
file may be read to recover an integer identifying the note group of the process
(see
.B RFNOTEG
in
.IR fork (2)).
The file may be written to cause the process to change to another note group,
provided the group exists and is owned by the same user.
