.SH NAME
kbmap \- keyboard map
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B bind -a #Îº /dev

.B /dev/kbmap
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I kbmap
device serves a one-level directory containing a single file,
.BR kbmap ,
representing the kernel's mapping of
keyboard scan codes to Unicode characters
(see
.IR cons (3)
and
.IR keyboard (6)).
.PP
Reads return the current contents of the map.
Each entry is one line containing three 11 character numeric fields, each followed by a space:
a table number, an index into the table (scan code), and the decimal value
of the corresponding Unicode character (0 if none).
The table numbers are platform dependent; they typically distinguish
between unshifted and shifted keys.
The scan code values are hardware dependent and can vary
from keyboard to keyboard.
.PP
Writes to the file change the map.
Lines written to the file must contain three space-separated numeric fields,
representing the table number, scan code index, and Unicode character.
Values are taken to be decimal unless they start with
.B 0x
(hexadecimal) or
.B 0
(octal).
The Unicode character can also be represented as
.BI ' x
where
.I x
gives the UTF-8 representation of the character
(see
.IR utf (6)).
