.SH DESCRIPTION
The syntax
.L #/
is illegal, so this device can only be accessed directly by the kernel.
.PP
This device is set up by the kernel to be the root of
the name space.
The names in the one-level tree are mostly just place-holders,
to allow a place to
.IR bind (2)
to.
The exception is
.BR /boot ,
which provides executable code when read.
The kernel does an
.IR exec (2)
of
.B /boot
when initializing.
Some kernels are built with other services, such as
.IR kfs (4) ,
in the root directory.
