.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The hard disk interfaces
.RI ( wren
is a SCSI disk;
.I hard
is a Safari's internal ST506 disk)
serve a one-level directory giving access to the
hard disk partitions.
The parameter to
.B attach
defines the numerical SCSI
.I target
and logical unit number to access.
Both default to zero.
.PP
Each partition name is prefixed by 
.B hd
and the numeric drive identifier.
The partition
.L disk
always exists and covers the entire disk.
The size of each partition as reported by
.IR stat (2)
is the number of bytes
in the partition, so the size of
.L disk
is the size of the entire disk.
.PP
The partition
.L partition
also always exists; it is the last block on the disk.
If it contains valid partition data, those partitions will be visible as well.
Every time the device is bound, the partitions are updated to reflect any changes
in the partition file.
.PP
The format of the
.B partition
file is the string
.IP
.B
plan9 partitions
.PP
on a line,
followed by a partition specification on a line consisting of a name
and textual strings for the block start and limit on the disk.
.PP
The program
.IR prep (8)
writes the
.B partition
table for the disk; its use is preferred to writing it by hand.
