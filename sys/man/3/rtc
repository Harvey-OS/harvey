.TH RTC 3
.SH NAME
rtc \- real-time clock and non-volatile RAM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind #r /dev
.PP
.B /dev/rtc
.br
.B /dev/nvram
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I rtc
device supports the
Mostek MK48T12-15 Zeropower/Timekeeper and similar devices
with real-time clocks and non-volatile RAM.
.PP
The
.B rtc
file behaves just like
.BR /dev/time
(see
.IR cons (3)).
The real-time clock is maintained on-board;
.B /dev/time
is set from the file server.  Neither is necessarily more accurate.
.PP
The
.B nvram
file provides (if permission allows)
access to the local non-volatile RAM.
For example,
.IR boot (8)
reads the machine's key
from there
(see
.IR auth (8)).
