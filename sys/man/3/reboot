.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a combined device and stream module (see
.IR stream (3)).
The bootstrap program
.IR boot (8)
pushes the module onto the file server connection of
a CPU server.  The system will then reboot automatically
if the connection hangs up.  The reboot may be
postponed by
.I delaytime
milliseconds by writing the decimal value of
.I delaytime
to
.LR #↑/deltat .
Conventionally, this is done by
.BR /rc/bin/cpurc
(see
.IR cpurc (8)).
This mechanism may be used to cause the machines at a particular
site to come up in a fixed order, such as after a power failure.
