.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Fcall is a
.I stream module
(see
.IR stream (3))
that can be pushed onto a connection to a 9P file server. The function
of the module is to recreate packet delimiters lost in transmission.
The 9P protocol demands that network connections preserve delimiters between
messages written to the file server.
Stream based protocols, like TCP, are unable to preserve
delimiters. The delimiters must be recreated by the receiver before a packet
is read by a file system.
.PP
.I Fcall
examines a data stream and identifies 9P messages from their type. The length
of the message is computed from the header.
Data is collected and buffered by the stream module until an entire 9P message
has been assembled. A single message is then delimited and sent upstream to be read
by a file server.
