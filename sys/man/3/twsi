device serves a one-level directory containing one file per TWSI or I⁲C bus.
Bytes written are transmitted on the bus;
bytes received from the bus are queued and delivered by reading.
Seeking to a given offset before reading or writing causes the
.I twsi
device to use that offset as a TWSI slave address for a subsequent
.IR read (2)
or
.IR write
call.
