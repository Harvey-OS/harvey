.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The SCSI CD-ROM disk interface
.RB ( #R )
serves a one-level directory for a SCSI target
holding a CD-ROM drive.
Each drive is represented as a single file named
.BI #R n /cd n\f1,\fP
where
.I n
is the target number.
A separate attach is necessary for each drive.
.PP
On PCs,
Panasonic, Matsushita, and Mitsumi CD-ROM drives connected to a
Sound Blaster 16, Pro, MCD, or ACX card are also supported.
This interface
.RB ( #m )
device serves a data file,
.BR #m/cd ,
and a control file,
.BR #m/cdctl .
The control file is read-only and contains a string stating the type of drive and
its port number.
The driver determines the type of CD-ROM drive by a parameter in
.BR plan9.ini ;
see
.IR plan9.ini (8).
