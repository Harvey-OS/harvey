.TH PIPE 3 
.SH NAME
pipe \- two-way interprocess communication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind #|
.I dir

.IB dir /data
.IB dir /data1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
An
.IR attach (5)
of this device allocates two new cross-connected I/O streams,
.IB dir /data
and
.IB dir /data1\f1.
.PP
Data written to one channel becomes available for reading at
the other.
Write boundaries are preserved: each read terminates
when the read buffer is full or after reading the last byte
of a write, whichever comes first.
.PP
Writes are atomic up to a certain size, typically 32768 bytes,
that is, each write will be delivered in a single read by the
recipient, provided the receiving buffer is large enough.
.PP
If there are multiple writers, each
.I write
is guaranteed to be available in a contiguous piece at the other
end of the pipe.
If there are multiple readers, each read will return data from only
one write.
.PP
The
.IR pipe (2)
system call performs an
.I attach
of this device and returns file descriptors to the new pipe's
.B data
and
.B data1
files.
The files are open with mode
.BR ORDWR .
