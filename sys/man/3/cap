cap \- capabilities for setting the user id of processes

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This device enables a trusted process to
create a capability that another process
may then use to change its user id.  The intent is to allow
server processes, for example
.B telnetd
(see
.IR ipserv (8)),
to change their user id after having proved
to a trusted process, such as
.IR factotum (4),
that they are indeed executing
on behalf of a user.
A trusted process is one running with the user id
of the host owner (see
.B /dev/hostowner
in
.IR cons (3)).
.PP
A capability is a null terminated string consisting of the concatenation of
an old user name, an ``@'', a new user name, an ``@'', and a string of randomly
generated characters called the key.
The trusted process enables the kernel to authenticate
capabilities passed to it by writing to
.I caphash
a secure hash of the capability.
The hash is 20 bytes long and generated by the following call:
.EX

	hmac_sha1(old_at_new, strlen(old_at_new), key, strlen(key),
		hash, nil);

.EE
The kernel maintains a list of hashes, freeing them after the
corresponding capability is used or after a minute has passed
since the write to
.IR caphash .
.PP
The trusted process may then pass the capability to any process
running as the old user.  That process may then
use the capability to change identity to the new user.
A process uses a capability by writing it to
.IR capuse .
The kernel computes the same hash using the supplied capability
and searches its list of hashes for a match.  If one is found,
the kernel sets the process's user id to that in the capability.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
Errors generated by reading and writing
.I caphash
and
.I capuse
can be obtained using
.IR errstr (2).
A read of
.I caphash
with a length of less than 20
or a write to
.I capuse
that doesn't contain two @ characters
generates the error ``read or write too small''.
A write to
.I capuse
that has no matching hash generates the error
``invalid capability''.
