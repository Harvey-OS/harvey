.TH INTRO 3 
.SH NAME
intro \- introduction to the Plan 9 devices
.SH DESCRIPTION
A Plan 9
.I device
implements a file tree for client processes.
A file name beginning with a pound sign, such as
.LR #c ,
names the root of a file tree implemented by
a particular
.IR "kernel device driver"
identified by the character after the pound sign.
Such names are usually bound to conventional locations
in the name space.
For example, after
.EX
	bind("#c", "/dev", MREPL)
.EE
an
.IR ls (1)
of
.B /dev
will list the files provided by the
.I console
device.
.PP
A kernel device driver is a
.I server
in the sense of the Plan 9 File Protocol, 9P (see Section 5),
but with the messages implemented by local
rather than remote procedure calls.
Also, several of the messages
.RI ( Nop ,
.IR Session ,
.IR Flush ,
and
.IR Error )
have no subroutine equivalents.
.PP
When a system call is passed a file name beginning with
.L "#"
it looks at the next character, and if that is a valid
.I device character
it performs an
.IR attach (5)
on the corresponding device to get a channel representing the
root of that device's file tree.
If there are any characters after the device character but
before the next
.L "/"
or end of string, those characters are passed as parameter
.I aname
to the attach.  For example,
.IP
.EX
#Itcp
.EE
.PP
identifies the implementation of the TCP protocol supplied by the IP device
(see
.IR ip (3)).
.PP
Each kernel device has a conventional place at which to be bound
to the name space.
The
.I SYNOPSIS
sections of the following pages includes a shell
.I bind
command to put the device in the conventional place.
Most of these binds are done automatically by
.IR init (8).
