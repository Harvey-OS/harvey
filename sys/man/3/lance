.SH DESCRIPTION
The LANCE Ethernet interface is a directory
containing 9 stream directories: one for each of 8 Ethernet packet types
and a
.B clone
file.
.PP
Each stream directory contains files to control the stream,
receive and send data,
and supply statistics.
Incoming Ethernet packets are demultiplexed by packet type and passed up
the corresponding open stream.
Reading from the
.B data
file reads packets at the head of the stream.
A read will terminate at packet boundaries.
Each write to the
.B data
file causes a packet to be sent.
The Ethernet address of the interface is inserted into
the packet header as the source address.
.PP
A stream is assigned a packet type by opening its
.B ctl
file and
writing 
.B connect
.I n
where
.I n
is a decimal integer constant identifying the Ethernet packet type.
A value of \-1 stands for all types.
If multiple streams are assigned to a given packet type
a copy of the packet is passed up each stream.
.PP
Reading the
.B type
file returns the decimal value of the assigned Ethernet packet type.
Reading the stats
file returns status information and the Ethernet address of the
interface.
.PP
An interface normally receives only packets whose 
destination address is that of the interface or is the
broadcast address,
.BR ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff .
The interface can be made to receive all packets on the
network by writing the string 
.B promiscuous
to the
.B ctl
file. 
The interface remains promiscuous until the control file is
closed.
The extra packets are passed up only streams of type \-1.
