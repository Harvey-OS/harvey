iproute \- Internet route table manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind \-a #P /net
.PP
.B /net/iproute
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I iproute
device allows the specification of routes for families of IP addresses.
It
maintains a kernel-resident routing table for IP addresses used by TCP, IL and UDP.
Each route consists of a destination IP address, an IP mask, and an IP gateway address.
Every packet sent by the system is routed according to the route table.
An address matches the route table entry when a packet's destination address
matches the table destination address under the mask. When a match is found,
the packet is sent to the gateway IP address. If there is no match, the
packet is sent with the original destination address.
If there are several matches, the one whose mask has the fewest
leading zeroes is chosen.
(Because of the definition of IP
masks, this mask preserves the largest portion of the address
and is therefore the most specific.)
This is
forced by storing the routes in decreasing number of ones order
and returning the first match.  The default gateway has no ones
in the mask and is thus the last matched.
.PP
Reading
.B iproute
reports the current routes entered in the table.
Writing control
messages to
.B iproute
edits the table.
Route entries are made by writing a string of format
.IP
.EX
add \f2ipdest mask ipgateway\fP
.EE
.PP
Entries are deleted by writing a string of format
.IP
.EX
delete \f2ipdest mask\fP
.EE
.PP
The whole table can be cleared by writing the string
.LR flush .
.PP
For example, to install a gateway address to accept all IP packets from a machine:
.IP
.EX
g% echo 'add 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.20.225.225' > /net/iproute
g% cat /net/iproute
0.0.0.0 & 0.0.0.0 -> 192.20.225.225
