.TH ENV 3
.SH NAME
env \- environment variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B bind #e /env

.BI /env/ var1
.BI /env/ var2
 ...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I env
device serves a one-level file directory containing files with arbitrary names
and contents.
The intention is that the file name is the name of an
.I environment variable
(see
.IR rc (1)),
and the content is the variable's current value.
.PP
When a
.IR fork (2)
system call creates a new process, both the parent and the
child continue to see exactly the same files in the
.I env
device: changes made in either process can be noticed by the other.
In contrast, an
.B rfork
system call with the
.B RFENVG
bit set (see
.IR fork (2))
causes a split: initially both process groups see the
same environment files, but any changes made in one process group
cannot be noticed by the other.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR rc (1),
.IR fork (2)
.SH BUGS
A write starting at an offset after the current extent of a file
yields an error instead of zero filling.
