.SH DESCRIPTION
The Datakit interface is a stream directory
containing a data and a control file.
Each write to the data file is a structured message.
The first two bytes of the message are a 9-bit virtual circuit number,
low order byte first.
The third byte is a control byte.
The rest are data bytes.
The data bytes are sent onto the Datakit virtual circuit, tagged as data, followed
by the control byte, tagged as control.
.PP
Messages coming from Datakit are read from the data file in the same
format.
A read terminates at the end of a message.
The largest possible received message is 1024 + 3 bytes.
