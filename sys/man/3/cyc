.TH CYC 3
.SH NAME
cyc \- Cyclone fiber interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind #C /dev
.PP
.B /dev/cyc
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cyc
device drives the Cyclone CVME961
.RI ( not
960)
card with an attached
SQFBR Squall module
to provide a high-speed point-to-point 9P link between a CPU
server and a file server.
Both machines must of course have VME buses.
For debugging,
the Cyclone may be loaded with on-board
software using
.B xms
(see
.IR con (1))
and the NINDY ROM supplied with the device.
In production, though, it is easiest to
replace the ROM with the program in the directory
.BR /sys/src/fs/cyc .
In either case, the on-board software expects an identical
Cyclone to be at the other end of the fiber.
One of the boards must be in a CPU server, the other in a
file server; the systems configure their respective
boards dynamically as appropriate.
.PP
The driver serves a single file,
.BR /dev/cyc .
When opened, the file initializes the connection to the file
server.  The resulting file descriptor should be used only
to send and receive 9P messages.
Typically
.IR boot (8)
will open
.BR /dev/cyc ,
prime the connection by sending
.B nop
and
.B session
messages (see
.IR attach (5)),
and then
.B mount
(see
.IR bind (2))
the file descriptor in the CPU server's name space.
Thenceforth all activity on
.B /dev/cyc
will be mediated by the mount driver
.IR mnt (3)).

.SH BUGS
The driver is specific to the SGI Power Series, although the device
should operate on any VME bus.
