.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vacfs
interprets the file system created by
.IR vac (1)
so that it can be mounted into a Plan 9 file hierarchy.
The data for the file system is stored on
.IR venti (8)
with a root fingerprint specified in
.IR vacfile .
.I Vacfs
is currently rather limited: access is read-only,
clients are not authenticated, and groups are assumed to
contain a single member with the same name.
These restrictions should eventually be removed.
.PP
Options to 
.I vacfs
are:
.TP
.BI -c " cachesize
The number of file system blocks to cache in memory. The default is 1000 blocks.
.TP
.B -d
Print debugging information to standard error.
.TP
.BI -h " host
The network address of the Venti server.
The default is taken from the environment variable
.BR venti .
If this variable does not exist, then the default is the
metaname 
.BR $venti ,
which can be configured via
.IR ndb (6).
.TP
.B -i
Use file descriptors 0 and 1 as the 9P communication channel rather than create a pipe.
.TP
.BI -m " mtpt
The location to mount the file system. The default is
.BR /n/vac .
.TP
.BI -p
Disables permission checking.
.TP
.B -s
Post the 9P channel in
.B /srv/vacfs
rather than
mounting it on
.IR mtpt .
.TP
.BI -S " srvname
Post the 9P channel in
.BI /srv/ srvname
rather than
mounting it on
.IR mtpt .
