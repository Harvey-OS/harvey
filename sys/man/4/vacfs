.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vacfs
interprets the file system created by
.IR vac (1)
so that it can be mounted into a Plan 9 file hierarchy.
The data for the file system is stored on
.IR venti (8)
with a root fingerprint specified in
.IR vacfile .
.I Vacfs
is currently rather limited: access is read-only,
clients are not authenticated, and groups are assumed to
contain a single member with the same name.
These restrictions should eventually be removed.
.PP
Options to 
.I vacfs
are:
.TF "-c\fI cachesize"
