nntpfs \- network news transport protocol (NNTP) file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nntpfs
[
.B -s
.I service
]
[
.B -m
.I mountpoint
]
.I system
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nntpfs
dials the TCP network news transport protocol (NNTP)
port, 119, on
.I system
(default
.BR '$nntp' )
and presents at
.I mountpoint
(default
.BR /mnt/news )
a file system corresponding to the
news articles stored on 
.IR system .
.PP
The file system contains a directory per newsgroup,
with dots turned into slashes, e.g.,
.B comp/os/plan9
for
.BR comp.os.plan9 .
Each newsgroup directory contains one
numbered directory per article.
The directories follow the numbering used by
the server.
Each article directory contains three files:
.BR article ,
.BR header ,
and
.BR body .
The
.B article
file contains the full text of the article,
while 
.B header
and 
.B body
contain only the header or body.
.PP
Each newsgroup directory contains a 
write-only
.B post
file that may be used to post news articles.
RFC1036-compliant articles should be written to it.
The
.B post
file will only exist in a given newsgroup directory
if articles are allowed to be posted to it.
Other than that, the
.B post
file is
.I not
tied to its directory's newsgroup.
The groups to which articles are eventually posted
are determined by the
.B newsgroups:
header lines in the posted article,
not by the location of the 
.B post
file in the file system.
.PP
The qid version of a newsgroup directory
is the largest numbered article directory it
contains (~0, if there are no articles).
.PP
The modification time on a newsgroup
directory is the last time a new article was recorded
during this 
.I nntpfs 
session.
To force a check for new articles,
.IR stat (2)
the newsgroup directory.
.PP
To force a check for new newsgroups,
.IR stat (2)
the root directory.
Note that this causes the entire list of groups,
which can be about a megabyte,
to be transferred.
.PP
To terminate the connection,
.B unmount
the mount point.
.PP
.I Nntpfs
makes no effort to send ``keepalives'' so that
servers do not hang up on it.
Instead, it redials as necessary when hangups are detected.
