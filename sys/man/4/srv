.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Srv
dials the given machine and initializes the connection to serve the
9P protocol.
It then creates in
.B /srv
a file named
.IR srvname .
Users can then
.B mount
(see
.IR bind (1))
the service, typically on a name in
.BR /n ,
to access the files provided by the remote machine.
If
.I srvname
is omitted, the first argument to
.B srv
is used.
Option
.B m
directs
.I srv
to mount the service on
.BI /n/ system
or onto
.I mtpt
if it is given.
Option
.B q
suppresses complaints if the
.B /srv
file already exists.
The 
.BR a ,
.BR b ,
.BR c ,
and
.B C 
flags are used to control the mount flag as in
.IR bind (1).
.PP
The specified
.I service
must serve 9P.  Usually
.I service
can be omitted; when calling some
non-Plan 9 systems, a
.I service
such as
.B u9fs
must be mentioned explicitly.
.PP
The
.I 9fs
command does the
.I srv
and the
.I mount
necessary to make available the files of
.I system
on network
.IR net .
The files are mounted on
.IR mountpoint ,
if given;
otherwise they are mounted on
.BI /n/ system\f1.
If
.I system
contains
.L /
characters, only the last element of
.I system
is used in the
.B /n
name.
.PP
.I 9fs
recognizes some special names, such as
.B dump
to make the dump file system available on
.BR /n/dump .
.I 9fs
is an
.IR rc (1)
script; examine it to see what local conventions apply.
.PP
.I Srvold9p
is a compatibilty hack to allow Fourth Edition Plan 9 systems
to connect to older 9P servers.
It functions as a variant of
.I srv
that performs a version translation on the 9P messages on the underlying connection.
Some of its options are the same as those of
.IR srv ;
the special ones are:
.TP
.B -d
Enable debuggging
.TP
.BI -u\  user
When connecting to the remote server, log in as
.IR user .
Since
.I srvold9p
does no authentication, and since new kernels cannot authenticate to
old services, the likeliest value of
.I user
is
.BR none .
.TP
.BI -x\  command
Run
.I command
and use its standard input and output as the 9P service connection.
If the
.I command
string contains blanks, it should be quoted.
.TP
.BI -n\  network-addr
Dial
.I network-addr
to establish the connection.
.TP
.BI -f\  file
Use
.I file
(typically an existing
.IR srv (3)
file) as the connection.
.TP
.B -F
Insert a special (internal) filter process to the connection to maintain
message boundaries; usually only needed on TCP connections.
.TP
.BI -p\  servicename
Post the service under
.IR srv (3)
as
.BI /srv/ servicename\f1.
.PP
.I Srvold9p
is run automatically when a
.IR cpu (1)
call is received on the service port for the old protocol.
.SH EXAMPLES
To see kremvax's and deepthought's files in
.B /n/kremvax
and
.BR /n/deepthought :
.IP
.EX
9fs kremvax
9fs hhgttg /n/deepthought
.EE
.PP
To mount as user
.B none
a connection to an older server kgbsun:
.IP
.EX
srvold9p -u none -m /n/kgbsun -p kgbsun -n il!kgbsun
.EE
.PP
Other windows may then mount the connection directly:
.IP
.EX
mount /srv/kgbsun /n/kgbsun
.EE
.SH NOTE
The TCP port used for 9P is 564.
.SH FILES
.TF /srv/*
.TP
.B /srv/*
ports to file systems and servers posted by
.I srv
and
.I 9fs
