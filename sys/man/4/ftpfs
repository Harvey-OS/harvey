.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ftpfs
dials the TCP file transfer protocol (FTP) port, 21, on
.I system
and mounts itself (see
.IR bind (2))
on
.I mountpoint
(default
.BR /n/ftp )
to provide access to files on the remote machine.
If required by the remote machine
.I ftpfs
will prompt for user name and password.
The user names
.B ftp
and
.B anonymous
are often used to offer guest/read-only access to
machines.
Anonymous ftp may be called without user interaction
by specifying the
.IR password .
.PP
By default the file seen at the mount point is the user's
home directory.
The option
.B -/
can be used to force the mount point to correspond to the
remote root.
.PP
To terminate the connection,
.B unmount
(see
.IR bind (1))
the mount point.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Symbolic links on remote Unix systems will always have mode 0777
and a length of 8.
.PP
After connecting to a TOPS-20 system, the mountpoint will contain
only one directory, usually
.BR /n/ftp/PS:<ANONYMOUS> .
However, walking to any valid directory on that machine will succeed
and cause that directory entry to appear under the mountpoint.
