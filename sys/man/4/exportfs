.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Exportfs
is a user level file server that allows Plan 9 compute servers, rather
than file servers, to export portions of a name space across networks.
The service is started either by the
.IR cpu (1)
command or by a network listener process.  An initial protocol
establishes a root directory for the exported name space.  The
connection to
.I exportfs
is then mounted, typically on
.BR /mnt/term .
.I Exportfs
then acts as a relay file server: operations in the imported file
tree are executed on the remote server and the results returned.  This
gives the appearance of exporting a name space from a remote machine
into a local file tree.
.PP
The
.B -a
option instructs
.I exportfs
to authenticate the user, usually because it is
being invoked from a remote machine.
.PP
The
.B -n
option disallows export to
user
.BR none .
.PP
The
.B -c
options specifies a network control file onto which
.I exportfs
will push the
.I fcall
line discipline.  This option is intended for networks that do not
preserve read/write boundaries.
.PP
The
.B cpu
command uses
.I exportfs
to serve device files in the terminal.  The
.IR import (4)
command calls
.I exportfs
on a remote machine, permitting users to access arbitrary pieces of
name space on other systems.
.PP
.I Srvfs
uses
.I exportfs
to create a mountable file system from a name space: a subsequent
.I mount
(see
.IR bind (1))
of
.BI /srv/ name
will reproduce the name space rooted at
.IR dir .
One might use
.I srvfs
to enable mounting of an FTP file system (see
.IR ftpfs (4))
in several windows.
