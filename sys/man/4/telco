.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Telco
is a file server that provides a network interface to
Hayes telephone dialers.
The interface is the same as that provided by
.IR ip (3)
and can be used by any program that makes network connections using
.IR dial (2).
The network addresses used by
.I telco
are telephone
numbers.
.PP
The options are
.TP
.B -p
use pulse dialing
.TP 
.B -v
verbose: write to the log file all communications with
the dialer.
.TP 
.B -i
specify a
.I source-id
to be used during FAX transfers
.PP
Some control of outgoing calls can be encoded
in the address.
Normally, addresses are of the form
.IB telco ! number\f1,
where 
.I number
is a decimal telephone number.
However, commas in the telephone number can be used to insert
pauses in the dialing process.
Dialing options can be added to the end of the address, separated
by
.BR ! 's.
The dialing options are
.TF baudrate
.TP
.B compress
turn on compression (default off)
.TP
.I baudrate
a decimal number representing the highest baud
rate with which to make the call
.TP
.B fax
to make a Class 2 facsimile call (used by programs such as
.IR faxsend )
.PD
.PP
.I Telco
also answers incoming calls.
Upon receiving a facsimile call,
.I telco
starts the script
.BR /rc/bin/service/telcofax .
For data calls it starts
.BR /rc/bin/service/telcodata .
Each is started with the network connection as both standard
input and standard output and with two arguments,
the file name of the network connection, e.g.,
.BR /net/telco/0/data ,
and the type of modem.
Currently, the only modem types supported are:
.TF ATT14400
.TP
.B MT1432
Multitech's 14400 baud modem
.TP
.B MT2834
Multitech's 28800 baud modem
.TP
.B ATT14400
the 14400 baud modem in Safaris
.TP
.B VOCAL
the 14400 baud Vocal modem
.PD
.PP
All other modems are assumed to be compatible with the standard
Hayes command subset.
.PP
.I Faxreceive
is normally started by
.BR /rc/bin/service/telcofax .
It reads and spools a CCITT Group 3 (G3) encoded FAX, and then starts the
script
.BR /sys/lib/fax/receiverc ,
passing it four arguments: the spool file name,
.B Y
(for success) or
.BR N ,
the number of pages, and the id string passed by the caller.
This script sends by
.IR mail (1)
notification to a list of recipients kept in the file
.BR /mail/faxqueue/faxrecipients ;
the script and the list
should be edited to match local needs.
.I Faxreceive's
options are:
.TP
.B -s
specify a different spool directory; the default is
.BR /mail/faxqueue .
.TP
.B -v
verbose: write to the log file all communications with
the modem.
.PP
.I Faxsend
transmits a FAX to
.IR address .
.I Page1
and all arguments that follow
are names of files containing G3 encoded
FAX images, one per page.
.PP
.I Fax
is a shell script that converts to G3 format
PostScript, G3, text, or other files acceptable to
.IR lp (1)
and queues the result
to be transmitted to a FAX machine.
A standard cover sheet, derived from
.BR /sys/lib/fax/h.ps ,
is sent before the message.
.I Telno
is the destination telephone number.
.I Recipient
is the name of the recipient to be placed
on the cover sheet.
If no
.I files
are specified, standard input is converted and sent.
The
.B -v
option invokes
.IR page (1)
on the generated G3 files
instead of transmitting them via FAX machine.
.SH EXAMPLE
Start the dialer on a PC, then use
.I con
to phone out.
.IP
.EX
telco /dev/eia1
con -l telco!18005551212
.EE
.PP
The connection will be made at the highest
negotiable baud rate.  To use the
best negotiable compression scheme as well:
.IP
.EX
con -l telco!18005551212!compress

.SH BUGS
.PP
These programs require the Class 2 facsimile interface.  This means that
.I faxsend
and
.I faxreceive
will not work on most portable computers since they have Class 1
interfaces.
.PP
The modem specific information is currently built into the source.
This should be in a user modifiable file.
