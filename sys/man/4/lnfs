.SH NAME
lnfs \- long name file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lnfs
[
.B -r
]
[
.B -s
.I srvname
]
.I mountpoint
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lnfs
starts a process that mounts itself (see
.IR bind (2))
on
.IR mountpoint .
It presents a filtered view of the files under the mount
point, allowing users to use long file names
on file servers that do not support file names
longer than 27 bytes.
.PP
The names used in the underlying file system are
the base32 encoding of the md5 hash of the longer
file name.  The user need not know the mapping
since
.I lnfs
does all the work.
.I Lnfs
maintains a file
.B .longnames
in the directory
.I mountpoint
to record the long file names.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B -r
allow only read access to the file system
.TP
.B -s
provide a service name,
.IR srvname ,
to post in
.BR /srv .
Without this option, no posting is performed.
.SH FILES
.B .longnames
.SH SOURCE
.B /sys/src/cmd/lnfs.c
.SH BUGS
This exists only to shame us into getting a real long
name file server working.
