.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Kfs
is a local user-level file server for a Plan 9 terminal with a disk.
.B Kfs
begins by
checking the file system for consistency,
rebuilding the free list, and placing a file descriptor in
.RI /srv/ service ,
where
.I service
is the service name (default
.IR kfs ).
If the file system is inconsistent,
the user is asked for permission to ream
.RI ( q.v. )
the disk.
The file system is not checked if it is reamed.
.PP
The options are
.TP
.BI "b " n
If the file system is reamed, use
.I n
byte blocks.
Larger blocks make the file system faster
and less space efficient.
.B 1024
and
.B 4096
are good choices.
.I N
must be a multiple of 512.
.TP
.B c
Do not check the file system.
.TP
.BI "f " file
Use
.I file
as the block storage file.
The default is 
.BR /dev/hd0fs .
.TP
.BI "n " name
Use
.RI kfs. name
as the name of the service.
.TP
.B r
Ream the file system, erasing all of the old data
and adding all blocks to the free list.
.TP
.B s
Post file descriptor zero in
.BI /srv/ service
and read and write protocol messages on file descriptor one.
