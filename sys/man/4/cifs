.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cifs
translates between Microsoft's file-sharing protocol
(a.k.a. CIFS or SMB) and 9P, allowing Plan9 clients to mount file systems
(shares or trees in MS terminology) published by such servers.
.PP
The root of the mounted directory contains one subdirectory per share,
always named in lower case, and a few virtual files of mixed case which
give additional server, session, share, and user information.
The arguments are:
.TF "-a\fI auth-method"
.PD
.TP
.BI -a " auth-method"
.I Cifs
authenticates using
.L BNTLM
by default, but alternative strategies may be
selected using this option.
.I Cifs
eschews cleartext authentication, however
it may be enabled with the
.L plain
auth method.
The list of currently-supported methods is printed
if no method name is supplied.
.IP
.I "Windows server 2003"
requires the
.B BNTLMv2
method by default, though it can be configured to be more flexible.
.TP
.B -b
Enable file ownership resolution in
.IR stat (2)
calls.
This requires an open and close per file and thus will slow
.I cifs
considerably; its use is not recommended.
.TP
.B -d
CIFS packet debug.
.TP
.B -D
9P request debug.
.TP
.BI -k " keyparam"
lists extra parameters which will be passed to
.IR factotum (4)
to select a specific key.
The remote servers's domain is always included in the keyspec,
under the assumption
that all servers in a Windows domain share an authentication domain;
thus
.I cifs
expects keys in
.I factotum
of the form:
.RS
.IP
.EX
key proto=pass dom=THEIR-DOMAIN service=cifs
	user=MY-USERNAME !password=XYZZY
.EE
.RE
.TP
.BI -m " mntpnt"
set the mount point for the remote filesystem;
the default is
.BI /n/ host.
.TP
.BI -n " called-name"
The CIFS protocol requires clients to know the NetBios name of the
server they are attaching to, the
.IR Icalled-name .
If this is not specified on the command line,
.I cifs
attempts to discover this name from the remote server.
If this fails it will then try
.IR host ,
and finally it will try the name
.LR *SMBSERVER .
.TP
.BI -s " srvname"
post the service as
.BI /srv/ srvname.
.TP
.I host
The address of the remote server to connect to.
.TP
.I share
A list of share names to attach on the remote server; if none is given,
.I cifs
will attempt to attach all shares published by the remote host.
.SS "Synthetic Files"
Several synthetic files appear in the root of the mounted filesystem:
.TF Workstations
.PD
.TP
.B Shares
Contains a list of the currently attached shares,
with fields giving the share name,  disk free space / capacity, the share type,
and a descriptive comment from the server.
.TP
.B Connection
Contains the username used for authentication,
server's called name, server's domain,
server's OS, the time slip between the local host and the server,
the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) the server requested, and optionally a flag
indicating only guest access has been granted.
The second line contains a list of capabilities offered by the server which is
mainly of use for debugging
.IR cifs .
.TP
.B Users
Each line contains a user's name, the user's full name,
and a descriptive comment.
.TP
.B Groups
Each line gives a group's name, and a list of the names of the users who
are members of that group.
.TP
.B Sessions
Lists the users authenticated, the client machine's NetBios name or IP address,
the time since the connection was established,
and the time for which the connection has been idle.
.TP
.B Domains
One line per domain giving the domain name and a descriptive comment.
.TP
.B Workstations
One line per domain giving the domain name and a descriptive comment,
the version number of the OS it is running, and comma-separated list of flags
giving the features of that OS.
.TP
.B Dfsroot
Top level DFS routing giving the DFS link type, time to live of the data,
proximity of the server, the Netbios or DNS name and
a physical path or a machine that this maps to.
.IP
DNS paths are usually assigned dynamicially as a form of load balancing.

.SH BUGS
NetApp Filer compatibility has not yet been tested; there may not be any.
.PP
DFS support is unfinished.
.PP
Kerbros authentication is unfinished.
.PP
NetBios name resolution is not supported, though it is now rarely used.
.PP
.I Cifs
has only been tested against
.IR aquarela (8),
Windows 95, NT4.0sp6,
Windows server 2003, WinXP pro, Samba 3.0, and Samba 2.0 (Pluto VideoSpace).
No support is attempted for servers predating NT 4.0.
