.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Paqfs
interprets the compressed read-only file system created by
.IR mkpaqfs (8)
and stored in
.I paqfile
so that it can be mounted into a Plan 9 file system.
.I Paqfs
is typically used to create a stand alone file system for
a small persistent storage device, such as a flash ROM.
It does not authenticate its clients and assumes each group
has a single member with the same name.
.PP
Option to 
.I paqfs
are:
.TP
.BI -c " cachesize
The number of file system blocks to cache in memory. The default is 20 blocks.
.TP
.B -d
Output various debugging information to
.IR stderr .
.TP
.B -i
Use file descriptors 0 and 1 as the 9P communication channel rather than create a pipe.
.TP
.BI -m " mtpt
The location to mount the file system. The default is
.BR /n/paq .
.TP
.BI -M " mesgsize
The maximum 9P message size. The default is sufficient for 8K byte read message.
.TP
.B -s
Post the 9P channel on #s/paqfs rather than
mounting it on
.IR mtpt .
.TP
.B -v
Verify the integrity of the
.IR paqfile .
Before mounting the file system, the
entire file is parsed and the 
.I sha1
checksum of the file system data is compared to the checksum embedded in the file.
This option enables the use of
.I paqfs
with files that consist of a 
.I paq
file system concatenated with additional data.
