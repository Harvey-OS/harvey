.B import

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Import
allows an arbitrary
.I file
on a remote
.I system
to be imported into the local name space.
Usually
.I file
is a directory, so the complete
file tree under the directory is made available.
.PP
A process is started on the
remote machine, with authority of the user of
.IR import ,
to perform work for the local machine using the
.IR exportfs (4)
service.
If
.I mountpoint
is omitted
.I import
uses the name of the remote
.I file
as the local mount point.
.PP
If
.I file
is a directory,
.I import
allows options exactly as in
.I mount
and
.IR bind (1)
to control the construction of union directories.
.PP
The
.B -f
option causes
.I import
to push the
.I fcall
line discipline on its network connection.  This option is intended for networks that do not
preserve read/write boundaries.
.SH EXAMPLE
Assume a machine
.B kremvax
that has IP interfaces for the company intranet and the global
internet mounted on
.I /net
and
.I /net.alt
respectively.
Any machine inside the company can get telnet out to the global
internet using:
.IP
.EX
import -a kremvax /net.alt
telnet /net.alt/tcp!ucbvax
