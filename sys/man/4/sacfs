.SH DESCRIPTION
Sacfs interprets the compressed, block based file system created by
.IR mksacfs (8)
and stored in
.I file
so that it can be mounted into a Plan 9 file system.
.I Sacfs
is typically used to create a stand alone file system from
a small persistent storage device, such as a flash rom.
It does not authenticate its clients and assumes each group
has a single member with the same name.
.PP
The
.B -s
flag causes
.I sacfs
to post its channel on
.BR #s/sacfs .
The
.B -i
flag causes
.I sacfs
to use file descriptors
.I infd
and
.I outfd
for its communication channel.
If neither
.B -s
nor
.B -i
are given,
.I sacfs
mounts itself on
.IR mountpoint
(default
.BR /n/c: ).
