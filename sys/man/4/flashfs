.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Flashfs
interprets the journal-based file system created by
.IR mkflashfs (8)
and stored in
.I file
(default
.BR /dev/flash/fs )
so that it can be mounted into a Plan 9 file system.
.I Flashfs
is typically used to create a stand alone file system from
a small persistent storage device, such as an erasable flash memory.
It does not authenticate its clients and assumes each group
has a single member with the same name.
.PP
The
.B -s
option causes
.I flashfs
to post its channel on
.BR #s/flashfs .
.I Flashfs
mounts itself on
.IR mountpoint
(default
.BR /n/brzr ).
The
.B -D
option turns on 9P debugging output.
The
.B -r
option makes the file system read-only.
.PP
The files and directory structure are divided into
.I sectsize
(default
.BR 4096 )
byte blocks.
Larger blocks make large files more compact but take longer to access.
Supplying the
.B -n
option forces
.I file
to contain exactly
.I nsect
sectors.
