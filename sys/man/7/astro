.SH SYNOPSIS
.B astro
[
.B -dlepsatokm
]
[
.BI -c n
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Astro
reports upcoming celestial events, by default for 24 hours starting now.
The options are:
.TP
.B d
Read the starting date.
A prompt gives the input
format.
.TP
.B l
Read the north latitude, west longitude, and elevation of the observation point
A prompt gives the input format.
If
.B l
is missing, the initial position is read from the file
.BR /lib/sky/here .
.TP
.B c
Report for
.I n
(default 1) successive days.
.TP
.B e
Report fractional overlap during eclipses.
.TP
.B p
Print the positions of objects at the
given time rather than searching for interesting
conjunctions.
For each, the name is followed by
the right ascension (hours, minutes, seconds),
declination (degrees, minutes, seconds),
azimuth (degrees),
elevation (degrees),
and semidiameter (arc minutes).
For the sun and moon, the magnitude is also printed.
.TP
.B s
Print output in English words suitable for speech synthesizers.
.TP
.B a
Include a list of artificial earth satellites for interesting events.
(There are no orbital elements for the satellites, so this option
is not usable.)
.TP
.B t
Read
ΔT
from standard input.
ΔT
is the difference between ephemeris and
universal time (seconds) due to the slowing of the earth's rotation.
ΔT
is normally calculated from an empirical formula.
This option is needed only for very accurate timing of
occultations, eclipses, etc.
.TP
.B o
Search for stellar occultations.
.TP
.B k
Print times in local time (`kitchen clock')
as described in the
.B timezone
environment variable.
.TP
.B m
Includes a single comet in the list of objects.
This is modified (in the source) to refer to an approaching comet
but in steady state
usually refers to the last interesting comet (currently Levy, 1990c).
