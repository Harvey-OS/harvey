.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.L qa
and
.L qw
indexes make heavy use of unpredictable abbreviations.
Entries for dates in the
.L qd
index include references that are
.IR ante ,
.IR post ,
and
.IR circa ;
the program does not distinguish these.
.PP
Tabular and other typographically complicated material is
missing from the database, and flagged by
.LR "{...}" .
.PP
A cross-reference that is not a main entry may be missing from the
.L le
index
(e.g., 
.I kinesthesia
refers to
.IR kinæsthesia ,
but the definition is found under
.IR kinæsthesis ).
The
.L -p
flag with a long prefix of the desired word is often successful.
