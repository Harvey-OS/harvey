.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dict
is a dictionary browser.
If a
.I pattern
is given on the command line,
.I dict
prints all matching entries;
otherwise it repeatedly accepts and executes commands.
The options are
.TF -d\ \fIdictname\fP
.TP
.BI -d " dictname"
Use the given dictionary.
The default is
.IR oed ,
the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.
Available dictionaries printed with
.B -d?
.TP
.B -k
Print a pronunciation key.
.PP
Patterns are regular expressions (see
.IR regexp (6)),
with an implicit leading
.L ^
and trailing
.LR $ .
Patterns are matched against an index of headwords and variants,
to form a `match set'.
By default, both patterns and the index are folded:
uppercase characters are mapped into their lowercase equivalents,
and Latin-1 accented characters are mapped into their non-accented
equivalents.
In interactive mode, there is always a `current match set'
and a `current entry' within the match set.
Commands can change either or both, as well as print the entries
or information about them.
.PP
Commands have an address followed by a command letter.
Addresses have the form:
.TF /\fIre\fP/.\fIn\fP
.TP
.BI / re /
Set the match set to all entries matching the regular expression
.IR re ,
sorted in dictionary order.
Set the current entry to the first of the match set.
.TP
.BI ! re !
Like
.BI / re /
but use exact matching, i.e., without case and accent folding.
.TP
.BI / re /. n
Like
.BI / re /
but set the current entry to the
.IR n th
of the match set.
.TP
.BI ! re !. n
Like
.BI / re /. n
but without folding.
.TP
.BI . n
Just change the current entry to the
.IR n th
of the current match set.
.TP
.I n
An integer
.I n
is an absolute byte offset into the raw dictionary.
(See the
.B A
command, below.)
.TP
.IB addr +
After setting the match set and current entry according to
.IR addr ,
change the match set and current entry to be the next entry
in the dictionary (not necessarily in the match set) after
the current entry.
.TP
.IB addr -
Like
.IB addr +
but go to previous dictionary entry.
.PP
The command letters come in pairs: a lowercase and the
corresponding uppercase letter.
The lowercase version prints something about the current
entry only, and advances the current entry to the next
in the match set (wrapping around to the beginning after
the last).
The uppercase version prints something about all of the
match set and resets the current entry to the beginning of
the set.
.TF \fLa,A\fP
.TP
.BR p , P
Print the whole entry.
.TP
.BR h , H
Print only the headword(s) of the entry.
.TP
.BR a , A
Print the dictionary byte offset of the entry.
.TP
.BR r, R
Print the whole entry in raw format (without translating
special characters, etc.).
.PP
If no command letter is given, the last-typed command letter is used.

.SH BUGS
A unicode font (e.g.
.BR /lib/font/bit/pelm/unicode.9.font )
should be used for best results.
.br
If the regular expression pattern doesn't begin with
a few literal characters, matching takes a long time.
