displays
a road map centered around some specified
place in the United States.
The data comes from the Census Bureau Tiger
Database.
The map is drawn in three shades of grey.

as rivers,
streams and lakes.
Dark grey is used for railroads and airports.
Black is used for roads.
On terminals with ldepth zero,
all shades appear black.

Without options,
the center of the map is the latitude
and longitude specified in the file
.BR /lib/sky/here .
If the
.B -g
option is given,
the center of the map will be the latitude
and longitude specified by continually monitoring the
end of the file
.BR /tmp/gpslog .
This file is written by the GPS satellite receiver
program
.IR gps .
With this option, and with
.I gps
running,
.I road
becomes a moving map display suitable for
cars or planes.
