.SH NAME
showimage \- bitmap displayer, colormap changer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B showimage
[
.I option
] [
.I file ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Showimage
displays the bitmap contained in
.I file
in the top left corner of the current window.
It goes to the next file when any character is typed,
exiting when there are no more files.
The options, all of which require no
.IR file ,
are:
.TP
.B -c
Load the standard Plan 9 colormap, if this is an 8-bit display.
The standard colormap takes the value of a pixel byte and
uses the top 3 bits for red darkness, the next 3 bits for green
darkness, and the final 2 for blue darkness.  So 0 is white
and 255 is black.  Exceptions: pixels 85 and 170 are intermediate
grey values, so that 2-bit-per-pixel grey scale images look right.
.TP
.B -g
Load the colormap with a linear grey scale, from 0 (white) to
max (black).
.TP
.B -r
Load the colormap with a reverse linear grey scale, from 0 (black) to
max (white).
.TP
.BI -m mapfile
Load the colormap from the file
.IR mapfile .
See
.IR rgbpix (2)
for the format.
.TP
.B -d
Dump the current colormap to standard output in the format of
.IR rgbpix (2).
