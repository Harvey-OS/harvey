.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cal
prints a calendar.
.I Month
is either a number from 1 to 12,
a lower case month name,
or a lower case three-letter prefix of a month name.
.I Year
can be between 1
and 9999.
If either
.I month
or
.I year
is omitted, the current month or year is used.
If only one argument is given, and it is a number larger than 12,
a calendar for all twelve months of the given year is produced;
otherwise a calendar for just one month is printed.
The calendar
produced is that for England and her colonies.
