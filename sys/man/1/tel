.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tel
looks up
.I key
in a private telephone book,
.BR $home/lib/tel ,
and in the public telephone book,
.BR /lib/tel .
It uses
.IR grep
(with the
.B -i
option to ignore case differences), so the key may be any part of a
name or number.  Customarily, the telephone book contains names,
userids, home numbers, and office numbers of users.  It also contains
a directory of area codes and miscellaneous people of general
interest.
.PP
.I Ppq
looks up entries in the Lucent personnel database.
Each search is against a single attribute.  The
possible search attributes are:
.IP tel
a telephone number. 
An entry matches if its telephone number ends in the
digits given in
.IR value .
.IP name
a proper name.
.I Value
must contain a family name, optionally prefixed
with first and middle names or initials separated by '.'s.
For example, emlin, grace.emlin, g.r.emlin can
can be used to look up Grace Roosevelt Emlin.
.IP org
an organization name.
.I Value
can be any prefix string of an organization number.
For example,
.B bl011
looks up everyone in research while
.B bl011273
looks up everyone in a single department.
.IP id
a post id.
.I Value
must exactly match the post id.
.PP
The attribute can be explicitly declared, e.g.
.BR tel=5551212 ,
or can be inferred from the form of the value using the following criteria:
.IP 1)
A
.I value
containing a '.' implies a name.
.IP 2)
Nothing but digits, '+', and '-' implies a telephone number.
.IP 3)
A mix of digits and letters implies an organization.
.IP 4)
Anything else implies two searches, first with the attribute
.B id
and if that fails, with attribute
.BR name .
.PP
With no flags,
.I ppq
returns for each match a single line containing
the employee's name, title, organization, location, room, telephone number,
and email address.
With 
.BR \-f ,
.I ppq
returns a fuller multiline entry for each match.
.PP
.I Iwhois
looks up names in the Internet NIC's personnel database.
.I Name
should be a surname optionally followed by a comma and given name.
A different server can be chosen by appending to the name an
.B @
followed by the server's domain name.
