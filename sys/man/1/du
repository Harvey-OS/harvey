.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Du
gives the number of Kbytes allocated to data blocks
of named
.I files
and, recursively, of files in named directories.
It assumes storage is quantized in units of 1024 bytes (Kbytes) by default.
Other values can be set by the
.B -b
option;
.I size
is the number of bytes, optionally suffixed
.B k
to specify multiplication by 1024.
If
.I file
is missing,
the current directory is used.
The count for a directory includes the counts of the 
contained files and directories.
The
.B -a
option prints the number of blocks
for every file in a directory.
Normally counts are printed only for contained directories.
