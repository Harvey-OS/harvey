.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wc
[
.B -lwrbc
]
[
.I file ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wc
counts lines, words, runes, syntactically-invalid
.SM UTF
codes and bytes in the named
.I files,
or in the standard input if no file is named.
A word is a maximal string of characters
delimited by spaces, tabs or newlines.
The count of runes includes invalid codes.
.PP
If the optional argument is present,
just the specified counts (lines, words, runes, broken
.SM UTF
codes or bytes)
are selected by the letters
.BR l ,
.BR w ,
.BR r ,
.BR b ,
or
.BR c .
Otherwise, lines, words and bytes
.RB ( -lwc )
are reported.
.SH BUGS
Three-byte
.SM UTF
codes higher than
.B F7 65 B7
(the
.SM UTF
encoding of
.BR FFFF )
are not counted among the illegals.
Unicode has many blank characters scattered through it,
but
.I wc
looks for only
.SM ASCII
space, tab and newline.
