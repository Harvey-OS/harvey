.TH PWD 1
.SH NAME
pwd, pbd \- working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pwd
.br
.B pbd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pwd
prints the path name of the working (current) directory.
.I Pwd
is guaranteed to return the same path that was used to
enter the directory.
If, however, the name space has changed, or directory names
have been changed, this path name may no longer be valid.
(See
.IR fd2path (2)
for a description of
.BR pwd 's
mechanism.)
.PP
.I Pbd
prints the base name of the working (current) directory.
It prints no final newline and is intended for applications
such as constructing shell prompts.
Since it uses
.IR stat (2)
to discover the name of
.B \&.
(dot),
if the directory has been bound to another name, it will show
the underlying name rather than that reported by
.IR pwd .
