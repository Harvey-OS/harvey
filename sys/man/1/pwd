.TH PWD 1
.SH NAME
pwd, pbd \- working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pwd
.br
.B pbd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pwd
prints the path name of the working (current) directory. Pwd
does not guarantee to return the same path that was used to
enter the directory. The returned path may be another route
through the name space to the same working directory. This behavior
will arise when a combination of mounts or binds produces a 
graph in the file tree.
.PP
.I Pbd
prints the base name of the working (current) directory.
It prints no final newline and is intended for applications
such as constructing shell prompts.
.SH SEE ALSO
.I cd
in
.IR rc (1),
.IR bind (1),
.IR getwd (2)
.SH BUGS
A kernel bug sometimes prevents
.B pbd
from working when the current directory is a device, in which
case
.I pbd
returns `.'.
