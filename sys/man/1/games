Remove all tiles
from the board. Click on tiles with the same face that
are not blocked by others. A blocked tile is one that is partially or
fully covered on top or has neighbouring tiles to the left and right.
The game finishes when either all tiles are gone or there are no
more moves left. The arguments are for changing background
.RB (-b),
tile
.RB (-t)
and layout
.RB (-l)
images;
.RB -c
selects a true-color buffer image, use with
drawterm or in case selecting a tile obscures it completely.
The 
.LR N
key will generate a new level, 
.LR R
restarts the current one. 
.LR Q
and 
.LR Del
quit, 
.LR H
gives a hint, either trying to match the currently selected tile, or if no tile is
selected finding out the first available tile.
.TP
.B sokoban
Guide Glenda through a room full of walls, pebbles and holes to put
the pebbles in.  Your goal is to arrange all pebbles into holes by
pushing them around, but you can only push a pebble if there is no
wall or another pebble blocking the way.
Arrow keys move Glenda up-down-left-right.  
.LR N 
and 
.LR P 
keys switch between
the next and previous levels, 
.LR R
restarts the current level.  
.LR Del 
and
.LR Q
quit.  The right mouse button invokes a menu to restart the current level or load different
level sets.  The middle mouse button lets you change between levels. 
.I Sokoban
accepts a level file as its argument.
