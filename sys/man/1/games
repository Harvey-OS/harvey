.TP
.B mahjongg
Remove all tiles
from the board. Click on tiles with the same face that
are not blocked by others. A blocked tile is one that is partially or
fully covered on top or has neighbouring tiles to the left and right.
The game finishes when either all tiles are gone or there are no
more moves left. The arguments are for changing background
.RB (-b),
tile
.RB (-t)
and layout
.RB (-l)
images;
.RB -c
selects a true-color buffer image, for use with
drawterm or in case selecting a tile obscures it completely;
.RB -f
causes mahjongg to indicate non-blocked tiles on mouse-over.
The 
.LR N
key will generate a new level, 
.LR R
restarts the current one. 
.LR Q
and 
.LR Del
quit, 
.LR H
gives a hint, either trying to match the currently selected tile, or if no tile is
selected finding out the first available tile.
.LR U
and
.LR Bksp
undo the last move,
.LR C
tries to solve the level.
.TP
.B memo
Remove all tiles from the board.
At first, pictures of various Bell Labs employees, Lucent Technologies' logo, and Glenda will appear.
Memorize the sequence, then click to hide them and begin.
Use the mouse to select two tiles.
If they are the same, the tiles will disappear, otherwise the tiles will flip back and you will get a chance to try again.
Button 3 generates a memu allowing you to restart, switch between easy and hard modes, and exit.
The
.B -h
option sets the game to hard mode.
Once the game has been completed, a message pops up with how long it took to win.
Use the button 3 menu to choose a mode, or click to play again.
.TP
.B sokoban
Guide Glenda through a room full of walls, pebbles and holes to put
the pebbles in.  Your goal is to arrange all pebbles into holes by
pushing them around, but you can only push a pebble if there is no
wall or another pebble blocking the way.
Arrow keys move Glenda up-down-left-right.  
.LR N 
and 
.LR P 
keys switch between
the next and previous levels, 
.LR R
restarts the current level.  
.LR Del 
and
.LR Q
quit.  Button 3 invokes a menu to restart the current level, load different level sets, and en- and disable animation of multi-step moves.
Button 2 lets you change between levels. 
Button 1 lets you do multi-step moves and pushes,
by clicking it on the destination where you want Glenda to go.
Glenda will only move if it can reach the destination.
For a multi-step push the pebble must be next to Glenda,
the destination must be on the same row or column,
and there must be a free place next to the destination
where the pebble can be pushed to.
Otherwise, if possible, Glenda will walk to the destination without pushing the pebble.
.I Sokoban
accepts a level file as its argument.
.TP
.B sudoku
.I Sudoku
is a puzzle game from Japan.  The goal of the game is to
fill the numbers 1 to 9 in all squares of the 9x9 board following a
few simple rules: no digit should repeat on the same row and column,
and no digit should repeat in the same 3x3 boxes outlined with thicker
lines.  The board is initially filled with a partial solution which
can be used for inferring digits for the empty squares.  The top row
of the board contains the digits 1 through 9, clicking on one of those
digits selects that number for placement on the board, clicking it
again will deselect that digit.  Clicking on an empty square will then
affix the square with the selected digit or, if no digit is selected
empty the square.

.SH BUGS
In 4s and 5s mouse warping (when the game is resumed,
and when a new tile appears) does not happen when
the mouse cursor is outside the game window.
Those who prefer to use the keyboard without the mouse
cursor blocking the view (or being warped all the time)
may consider this a feature.
