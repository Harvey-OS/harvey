vncviewer \- remote frame buffer viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vncviewer
[
.B -e
.I encodings
]
[
.B -csv
]
.IR host [\fL: n ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vncviewer
provides access to remote frame buffer
.I n
on 
.I host
using the VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
protocol.
It resizes its window to be the smaller of the
remote frame buffer size and the local screen.
.PP
The 
.B -e
option specifies an ordered list of rectangle
encodings to allow in the protocol.
The default (and full set) is 
.IP
.EX
copyrect corre hextile rre raw
.EE
.PP
By default, connecting to a display closes 
any other connections to that display.
The
.B -s
option allows the other connections to share the display.
.PP
The
.B -v
option causes verbose output.
.PP
.I Vncviewer
negotiates with the VNC server to settle on a true-color pixel format.
For true-color displays, this is the native display pixel format.
On eight bit color-mapped displays,
.I vncviewer
requests 
.B r3g3b2
pixels and upon receipt translates them to the nearest
color in the map.
This does not cover the color map particularly well.
When invoked with the
.B -c
option,
.I vncviewer
requests
.B r4g4b4
pixels instead.  This consumes more bandwidth
but results in better matching to the available colors.
.PP
.I Vncviewer
correctly handles the typing of control characters
and shifted keystrokes.
To support systems that require the use
of modifiers like Alt, Ctl, and Shift on
things like mouse events,
typing the sequences
.B Alt
.B Z
.B A
(for Alt), 
.B Alt
.B Z
.B C
(for Ctrl),
and
.B Alt
.B Z
.B S
(for Shift)
will send a ``key down'' message for
the given key (see
.IR keyboard (6)).
A corresponding ``key up'' message
will be sent after the next key is pressed,
or when the sequence is retyped,
whichever happens first.

.SH BUGS
If the remote frame buffer is larger than the
local screen, only the upper left corner can
be accessed.
