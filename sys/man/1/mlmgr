.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mlmgr
creates and updates unmoderated mailing lists.
The
.B -c
option creates mail directories for both
.I listname
and
.IB listname -owner\f1,\fP
each containing a
.B pipeto
file.
Messages mailed to
.I listname
are sent to all members of the mailing list.
Any
.B Reply-to:
and
.B Precedence:
fields are
removed from the messages and new ones are added
directing replies to
.I listname
and specifying bulk precedence.  The envelope address for
error replies is set to
.BR /dev/null .
.PP
The mailing list membership is the file
.BR /mail/box/\fIlistname\fP/address-list .
This file is an add/remove log.  Each line
represents a single address.  Lines beginning
with a hash
.RB ( # )
are comments.
Lines beginning with an exclamation point
.RB ( ! )
are removals.
All other lines are additions.
.PP
Addition and removal entries can be appended using the
.B -a
and
.B -r
options to
.IR mlmgr .
However, they are normally appended as a consequence or
user requests.
.PP
To be added or removed from the list, a user
may send a message to
.IB listname -owner\f1.\fP
containing a key word in
the header or body.  The key words are:
.IP
subscribe - add my
.B From:
address to the list
.IP
remove - remove my
.B From:
address from the list
.IP
unsubscribe - remove my
.B From:
address from the list
.PP
Addition and removal events cause notification messages to
be sent to the added/removed address.   In the case of
addition, the message describes how to be removed.
.PP
.I Ml
and
.I mlowner
are the programs that receive messages for
.I listname
