replaces a rio window with a fresh instance of the shell
.IR rc (1)
running within an emulation of a DEC VT-100 terminal.
The
.BR -2 ,
.B -a
and
.B -x
options change
.I vt
to emulate a VT-220, ANSI, or XTerm terminal respectively.
.PP
The
.B -s
option changes the color scheme to black text on a white background.
.PP
The
.B -f
option sets the font.
.PP
The right button has a menu with the following entries to provide
the sort of character processing expected by non-Plan 9 systems:
.TF cooked
.TP
.B 24x80
Resize the
.I vt
window to hold 24 rows of 80 columns.

.SH BUGS
.PP
This program is used only for communicating with foreign systems, so it is not
as rich an emulation as its equivalent in other environments.
.PP
Use care in setting raw and newline modes when connecting to Unix systems
via
.IR con (1)
or
.IR ssh (1).
It may also be necessary to set the emulator into raw mode.
