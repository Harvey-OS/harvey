.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vt
[
.B -2sa
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vt
replaces a rio window with a fresh instance of the shell
.IR rc (1)
running within an emulation of a DEC VT-100 terminal.
The
.B -2
and
.B -a
options configure
.I vt
to emulate a VT-220 and Ansi terminal respectively.
The
.B -s
options forces a saner color scheme, i.e, black text on white
background.
.PP
The right button has a menu with the following entries to provide
the sort of character processing expected by non-Plan 9 systems:
.TF cooked
.TP
.B 24x80
Resize the
.I vt
window to hold 24 rows of 80 columns.
.TP
.B crnl
Print a newline (linefeed) character after receiving a carriage return from the host.
.TP
.B cr

.TP
.B nlcr

.SH BUGS
.PP
This program is used only for communicating with foreign systems, so it is not
as rich an emulation as its equivalent in other environments.
.PP
Use care in setting raw and newline modes when connecting to Unix systems
via
.IR con .
It may also be necessary to set the emulator into raw mode.
