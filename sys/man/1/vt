.SH BUGS
This program is used only for communicating with foreign systems,
so it is not
as rich an emulation as its equivalent in other environments.
.PP
Use care in setting raw and newline modes when connecting to Unix systems
via
.IR con (1)
or
.IR ssh (1).
It may also be necessary to set the emulator into raw mode.
