.SH SYNOPSIS

.I option ...

[

.br
etc.
.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs
assemble the named files into object files
for the corresponding architectures; see
.IR 2c (1)
for the correspondence between an architecture and the character
.RB ( 1 ,
.RB 2 ,
etc.) that specifies it.
The assemblers handle the most common C preprocessor directives and the associated
command-line options
.BR -D
and
.BR -I .
Other options are:
.TP
.BI -o " obj"
Place output in file
.I obj
(allowed only if there is just one input file).
Default is to take the last element of the input path name,
strip any trailing
.BR .s ,
and append
.RI . O ,
where
.I O
is first letter of the assembler's name.
.SH FILES
The directory
.B /sys/include
is searched for include files after
machine-dependent files in
.BR /$objtype/include .
.SH SOURCE
.BR /sys/src/cmd/2a ,
etc.
.SH SEE ALSO

.IR 2l (1).

some have been retired and some
are provided by third parties.
