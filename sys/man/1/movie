.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Movie
converts a `movie script'
into an internal representation, then displays it in a window.
Or, if the input file is already in the internal representation
format, the conversion step is skipped.
The
.B -d
option says to leave the internal representation around in a file
with the same name as the input file, with the suffix (if any)
replaced by
.BR .i .
If no file names are given, standard input is used.
If more than one file name is given, they are each animated in turn.
.PP
Button 1 stops and starts the movie;
button 2 adjusts view sizes and selects clicks;
button 3 sets various parameters.
The `new file' option on the button 3 menu prompts for
another file to display; that file must be in internal representation format.
.SS Movie scripts
A movie consists of multiple independent views,
each presented as a rectangular sub-window.
If no 
.B view
statements appear, there is a single implicit view
.BR def.view .
Any text or geometrical object may be labeled with a name and colon.
Labels and coordinates are local to views.
A recurring label erases the previous
object with that label.
