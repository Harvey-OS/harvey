bundle \- collect files for distribution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bundle
.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bundle
writes on its standard output a shell script for
.IR rc (1)
or a Bourne shell
which, when executed,
will recreate the original
.IR files .
Its main use is for distributing small numbers of text files by
.IR mail (1).
.PP
Although less refined than standard archives from
.IR ar (1)
or
.IR tar (1),
a
.IR bundle
file
is self-documenting and complete; little preparation is required on
the receiving machine.

bundle mkfile *.[ch] | mail kremvax!boris

files.
Upon receiving the mail, Boris may save the file sans postmark,
say in

then do
.TP
.L
cd gift; rc horse; mk
