.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ms2html
converts the
.IR ms (6)
source on standard input into HTML and prints it to
standard output.
If the source contains
.IR tbl (1)
or
.IR eqn
input, you must first pipe the text through those
preprocessors.
Postscript images, equations, and tables will be
converted to gif files.
If the document has a
.B .TL
entry, its contents will be used as the title; otherwise
.I ms2html
will look for a
.B ._T
macro, unknown to
.IR ms (6),
and take its value.
