.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Mail
Mail is a shell script that invokes
.I upas/nedmail
when no  recipients appear on the command line and
.I upas/marshal
otherwise.
All command line options are passed through.
.SS "Sending mail
.I Marshal
builds a mail message from standard input and passes it to
.I send
for transmission or delivery.
It adds to the beginning of the message any headers in the file
.BI /mail/box/ username /headers\f1.
This allows the addition of personal headers like
.B From:
lines with a full name or a different
return address.
The message format is both RFC 822 and
MIME conformant, so
.I marshal
adds any required headers not already in the message.
Command line options direct marshal to add a subject line
and append attachments.  The arguments to
.I marshal
are the addresses of the recipients.
.PP
When running in a
.IR rio (1)
window,
.I marshal
automatically puts the window into hold mode (see
.IR rio (1));
this means that the message can be edited freely,
because nothing will be sent to
.I marshal
until the ESC key is hit to exit hold mode.
.PP
The options are:
.TF "-a file"
.TP
.BI -a file
directs
.I marshal
to append 
.I file
as a mime attachment.
Unless explicitly specified by the
.B -t
option, the type of the attachment is determined
by running the
.IR file (1)
command.
.TP
.BI -A file
is like
.B -a
but the message disposition is marked as
.I inline
directing any mail reader to display the attachment
(if it can) when the mail message is read.
.TP
.BI -t type
sets the content type for the attachments from
all subsequent
.B -a
and
.B -A
options.
.TP
.BI -s subject
adds a
.B Subject:
header line to the message if one does not
already exist.
.TP
.B -#xnr
are all passed as command line options to the
.I send
that
.I marshal
invokes.
.PD
.PP
.I Send
reads a message from standard input and disposes of it in one
of four ways:
.IP \(bu 3
If
.I mailaddr
refers to a local mailbox, it appends it to the
recipient's mailbox.
.IP \(bu
If
.I mailaddr
is remote, it queues the mail for remote delivery.
.IP \(bu
If the
.B -r
option is given and the mail is undeliverable, it
returns the mail to the sender.
.IP \(bu
if the
.B -r
option is not given and the mail is undeliverable, it
appends the mail to
.BI /mail/box/ username /dead.letter
and prints a message to standard error.
.PP
The file
.B /mail/lib/rewrite
determines exactly how to deliver or queue the mail.
The decision is based purely on the recipient address.
.PP
The options are:
.TF -b
.TP
.B -b
suppresses the addition of the
.B To:
line.
.TP
.B -i
let the message input be terminated by a line
containing only a period, for
compatibility with
old mailers.
.TP
.B -x
do not send mail, but instead report
the full mail address of the recipient.
.TP
.B -#
do not send mail, but instead report
what command would be used to send the mail.
.TP
.B -r
input is via a pipe from another program.
Expect a From
line at the start of the message to provide the
name of the sender and timestamp.  This implies
the
.B -b
option.
.SS "Reading mail"
.I Nedmail
edits a mailbox.
The default mailbox is
.BI /mail/box/ username /mbox\f1.
The
.B -f
command line option specifies an alternate mailbox.
Unrooted path names are interpreted relative to
.BI /mail/box/ username.
If the
.I mailfile
argument is omitted, the name defaults to
.BR stored .
.PP
The options are:
.TF "-f mailfile"
.TP
.BI -c " dir
Create a mailbox.  If
.I dir
is specified, the new mailbox is created in
.BI /mail/box/ username / dir /mbox\f1.
Otherwise, the default mailbox is created.
.TP
.B -r
Reverse: show messages in first-in, first-out order; the default is last-in, first-out.
.TP
.BI -f " mailfile"
Read messages from the specified file (see above) instead of the default mailbox.
.TP
.BI -s " mailfile"
Read a single message file
.IR mailfile ,
as produced by
.IR fs ,
and treat it as an entire mailbox.
This is provided for
use in plumbing rules; see
.IR faces (1).
.PD
.PP
.I Nedmail
starts by reading the mail box, printing out the number
of messages, and then prompting for commands from standard input.
Commands, as in
.IR ed (1),
are of the form
.RI `[ range ]
.I command
.RI [ arguments ]'.
The command is applied to each message in the (optional) range.
.PP
The address range can be:
.TP 1.4i
.I address
to indicate a single message header
.PD 0
.TP
.IB address , address
to indicate a range of contiguous message headers
.TP
.BI g/ expression /
to indicate all messages whose headers match the regular
.IR expression .
.TP
.BI g% expression %
to indicate all messages whose contents match the regular
.IR expression .
.PD
.PP
The addresses can be:
.TP 1.4i
.I number
to indicate a particular message
.PD 0
.TP
.IB address . number
to indicate a subpart of a particular message
.TP
.BI / expression /
to indicate the next message whose header matches
.I expression
.TP
.BI % expression %
to indicate the next message whose contents match
expression
.TP
.I "empty or .
to indicate the current message
.TP
.BI - address
to indicate backwards search or movement
.PD
.PP
Since messages in MIME are hierarchical
structures, in
.I nedmail
all the subparts are individually addressable.
For example if message 2 contains 3 attachments,
the attachments are numbered 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.
.PP
The commands are:
.TP 1.1i
.BI a " args
Reply to all addresses in the
.BR To: ,
.BR From: ,
and
.BR Cc:
header lines.
.I Marshal
is used to format the reply and any arguments the
user specifies are added to the command line to
.I marshal
before the recipient.
The possibility of making a fool of yourself is very
high with this command.
.PD 0
.TP
.BI A " args
Like 
.B a
but with the message
appended to the reply.
.TP
.B b
Print the headers for the next ten messages.
.TP
.B d
Mark message to be deleted upon exiting
.IR nedmail .
.TP
.B f
Append the message to the file 
.BI /mail/box/ username / sendername
where
.I sendername
is the account name of the sender.
.TP
.B h
Print the disposition, size in characters, and header line of the message.
.TP
.B help
Print a summary of the commands.
.TP
.BI m " person ...
Forward the message as a mime attachment to the named
.IR persons .
.TP
.BI M " person ...
Like
.B m
but allow the user to type in text to be included
with the forwarded message.
.TP
.B p
Print message.	An interrupt stops the printing.
.TP
.BI r " args
Reply to the sender of the message.
.I Marshal
is used to format the reply.
If and optional
.I Args
are specified, they are added to the command line to
.I marshal
before the recipient's address.
.TP
.B R " args 
Like
.B r
but with the original message included as an attachment.
.TP
.B rf
Like
.B r
but append the message and the reply to the file 
.BI /mail/box/ username / sendername
where
.I sendername
is the account name of the sender.
.TP
.B Rf
Like 
.B R
but append the message and the reply to the file 
.BI /mail/box/ username / sendername
where
.I sendername
is the account name of the sender.
.TP
.BI s " mfile"
Append the message to the specified mailbox.
If
.I mfile
doesn't start with a `/', it is interpreted relative to the directory in which the mailbox resides.
.TP
.B q
Put undeleted mail back in the mailbox and stop.
.TP
EOT (control-D)
Same as 
.BR q .
.TP
.BI w " file
Same as
.B s
with the mail header line(s) stripped.  This can be used to
save binary mail bodies.
.TP
.B u
Remove mark for deletion.
.TP
.B x
Exit, without changing the mailbox file.
.TP
.BI | command
Run the
.I command
with the message as standard input.
.TP
.BI ! command
Escape to the shell to do
.IR command .
.TP
.B \&=
Print the number of the current message.
.PD
.PP
Here's an example of a mail session that looks at a summary
of the mail messages, saves away an html file added as an
attachment to a message and then deletes the message:

.EE
.PP
Notice that the delete of message 1.2 deleted the entire message and
not just the attachment.
.SS "Aliasmail"
.I Aliasmail 
expands mail aliases, its arguments, according to alias files.
Each line of an alias file begins with
.B #
(comment) or with a name.
The rest of a name line gives the expansion.
The expansion may contain multiple addresses and may be continued
to another line by appending a backslash.
Items are separated by white space.
.PP
In expanding a name, the sender's personal alias file
.BI /mail/box/ username /names 
is checked first.
Then the system alias files, listed one per line in
.BR /mail/lib/namefiles  ,
are checked in order.
If the name is not found, the expansion is taken to be
.BI local! name\f1.
Under the
.B -f
option,
alias files listed in
.B /mail/lib/fromfiles
are consulted instead,
and the domain part only of the expansion is printed.
.SS Mailboxes
Incoming mail for a user
.I username
is put in the file
.BI /mail/box/ username /mbox
unless either the file
.BI /mail/box/ username /forward
or
.BI /mail/box/ username /pipeto
exists.
The mailbox must have append-only and exclusive-access mode
(see
.IR chmod (1)).
A user must create his or her own mailbox using the
.B -c
option of
.IR nedmail .
Mailboxes are created writable (append-only) but not readable by others.
.SS Forwarding
If the file
.BI /mail/box/ username /forward
exists and is readable by everyone, incoming mail
will be forwarded to the addresses contained in the first line of the file.
The file may contain multiple addresses.
Forwarding loops are caught and resolved by local delivery.
.SS Filtering
If the file
.BI /mail/box/ username /pipeto
exists and is readable and executable by everyone,
it will be run for each incoming message for the user.
The message will be piped to it rather
than appended to his/her mail box.
The file is run as user
.B none
with arguments of the resolved address of
.I username
(e.g.
.BR local!presotto )
and his/her mail box name.
.PP
.I Filter
provides simple mail filtering.
The first two arguments are the recipient's address and mailbox, i.e.,
the same arguments provided to
.BR pipeto .
The remaining arguments are all paired; a regular expression and a file name.
With no flags, the sender's address is matched against each
regular expression starting with the first.  If the expression
matches, then the message is delivered to the file whose name
follows the expression.  The file must be world writable and should
be append only.
A message that matches none of the expressions is delivered into
the user's standard mail box.
The flags are:
.TP
.B h
the regular expression is matched against the message header
rather than the address.
.TP
.B b
the regular expression is matched against both the header and the body
of the message.
.PP
For example, to delete any messages of precedence bulk, place in
your
.B pipeto
file:
.EX
/bin/upas/filter -h $1 $2 'Precedence: bulk' /dev/null
.EE
.SS "Mime File system
.PP
.I Fs
is a user level file system that reads mailboxes and presents them as a file
system.
A user normally starts
.I fs
in his/her profile after starting
.IR plumber (4)
and before starting
a window system, such as
.IR rio (1)
or
.IR acme (1).
The file system is used by
.I nedmail
and
.IR acme (1)'s
mail reader to parse messages.
.I Fs
also generates plumbing messages used by
.IR biff
and
.IR faces (1)
to provide mail announcements.
.PP
The mailbox itself becomes a directory under
.BR /mail/fs .
Each message in the mailbox becomes a numbered directory in the
mailbox directory, and each attachment becomes a numbered directory
in the message directory.  Since an attachment may itself be a mail message,
this structure can recurse ad nauseam.
.PP
Each message and attachment directory contains the files:
.TP 1.4i
.B body
.PD 0
the message minus the RFC822 style headers
.TP
.B cc
the address(es) from the CC: header
.TP
.B date
the date in the message, or if none, the time of delivery
.TP
.B digest
an SHA1 digest of the message contents
.TP
.B disposition
.B inline
or
.B file
.TP
.B filename
a name to use to file an attachment
.TP
.B from
the from address in the From: header, or if none,
the address on the envelope.

.PP
The mailbox is reread and the structure updated
whenever the mailbox changes.  Message directories are
not renumbered.
.PP
The file
.B /mail/fs/ctl
is used to direct
.I fs
to open/close new mailboxes or to delete groups of messages atomically.
The messages that can be written to this file are:
.TP 2i
.PD 0
.B "open \fIpath mboxname\fP
opens a new mailbox.
.I path
is the file to open, and
.I mboxname
is the name that appears under
.BR /mail/fs .
.TP
.B "close \fImboxname\fP
close
.IR mboxname .
The close takes affect only after all files open under
.BI /mail/fs/ mboxname
have been closed.
.TP
.B "delete \fImboxname number ...\fP
Delete the messages with the given numbers from
.IR mboxname.
.PD
.PP
The options are:
.TF "-f file
.TP
.BI -f file
use
.I file
as the mailbox instead of the default,
.BI /mail/box/ username /mbox.
.PD 0
.TP
.B -b
stands for biffing.  Each time new mail
is received, a message is printed to standard
output containing the sender address, subject,
and number of bytes.  It is intended for
people telnetting in who want mail announcements.
.TP
.B -n
Don't open a mailbox initially.  Overridden by -f.
.TP
.B -p
turn off plumbing.  Unless this is specified,
.I fs
sends a message to the plumb port,
.BR seemail ,
from source
.B mailfs
for each message received or deleted.
The message contains the attributes
.IR sender = "<contents of from file>" ,
.IR filetype =mail,
.IR mailtype = "deleted or new" ,
and
.IR length = "<message length in bytes>" .
The contents of the message is the full path
name of the directory representing the message.
.TP
.B -s
causes
.I fs
to put itself in
.B /srv
with a name of the form
.BR /srv/upasfs.\fIuser\fB .

specifies a mount point other than
.BR /mail/fs .
.PD
.PP
.I Fs

have disappeared.
.SS "Mail Announcements
.PP
.I Biff
is the textual equivalent of
.IR faces (1).
It listens to plumbing messages from
.I fs
and for each new message prints to standard output a line
containing the sender address, subject,
and number of bytes.
It exists for people without graphics capability or with screens too small to
dedicate the space
.IR faces (1)
requires.  It forks to place itself in the background.
.SS "Remote delivery
.PP
.I Smtp
sends the mail message from standard input
to the users
.I rcpt-list
on the host at network address
.I address 
using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
The return address of the mail will contain the local
system name from the environment variable
.I sysname
and the user
.IR sender .
The
.B -h
option uses
.I host
as the local system name;
it may be fully-qualified or not.
If
.I .domain
is given, it is appended to the end of the system name.
The
.B -f
option just prints out the converted message rather than
sending it to the destination.
The
.B -g
option specifies a gateway system to pass the message to if smtp can't
find an address or MX entry for the destination system.
The
.B -d
option turns on debugging output to standard error.
.PP
.I Smtpd
receives a message using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
Standard input and output are the protocol connection.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 1.1i
.B -d
turns on debugging output to standard error.
.TP
.B -r
turns on forward DNS validation of non-trusted sender address.
.TP
.B -f
prevents relaying from non-trusted networks.
.TP
.B "-n \fItcp-directory\fP"
specifies the name of the network directory assigned to the incoming connection.
This is used to determine the peer IP address.  If this flag is not
specified, the peer address is determined using standard input.
.TP
.B "-h \fIdomain\fP"
specifies the receiving domain.  If this flag is not specified, the
receiving domain is inferred from the host name.
.TP
.B -s
causes copies of blocked messages to be saved in a sub-directory of
.BR /mail/queue.dump .
.TP
.B "-k \fIIP address\fP"
causes connections from the host at
.I "IP address"
to be dropped at program startup.  Multiple addresses
can be specified with several
.B -k
options.  This option should be used carefully;
it is intended to lessen the effects of denial of
service attacks or broken mailers which continually
connect.  The connections are not logged and the
remote system is not notified via the protocol.
.PP
.I Smtpd
is normally run by a network listener such as
.IR listen (8).
Most of the command line options are more conveniently
specified in the smtpd configuration file stored in
.BR /mail/lib/smtpd.conf .
.SS "Mail server
.I Pop3
is a rudimentary POP3 server that uses APOP for authentication.
It predates

.I Biff
and 
the
.B \-b
option of
.I fs
perform the same function but in slightly
different environments.
The duality is confusing.
The 
.B \-b
option exists because starting both
.I fs
and
.I biff
in a Telnet session results in a number
of processes that don't die when the
session is terminated; the
.IR plumber (4)
is held open by
.I fs
and
.I biff
still having it mounted, while
.I fs
is held open by
.I biff
which is blocked waiting for plumbing
input.
