.TH KILL 1
.SH NAME
kill, broke \- print commands to kill processes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kill
.I name
.PP
.B broke
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Kill
prints commands that will cause all processes called
.I name
and owned by the current user to be terminated.
Use the
.B send
command of
.IR 8Â½ (1),
or pipe the output of
.I kill
into
.IR rc (1)
to execute the commands.
.PP
.I Kill
suggests sending a
.B "kill"
note to the process; the same
message delivered to the process's
.B ctl
file (see
.IR proc (3))
is a surer, if heavy handed, kill,
but is necessary if the offending process is
ignoring notes.
.PP
.I Broke
prints commands that will cause all processes
in the
.I Broken
state
and owned by the current user to go away.
When a process dies because of an error caught by
the system, it may linger in the
.I Broken
state allowing examination with a debugger.
Executing the commands printed by
.I broke
lets the system reclaim the resources used by
the broken processes.
