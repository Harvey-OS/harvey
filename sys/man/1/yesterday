.TH YESTERDAY 1
.SH NAME
yesterday \- print file names from the dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yesterday
[
.B -c
] [
.I \-date
]
.I files ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Yesterday
prints the names of the
.I files
from the most recent dump.
Since dumps are done early in the morning,
yesterday's files are really in today's dump.
For example, if today is March 17, 1992,
.IP
.EX
yesterday /adm/users
.EE
.PP
prints
.IP
.EX
/n/dump/1992/0317/adm/users
.EE
.PP
In fact, the implementation is to select the most recent dump in
the current year, so the dump selected may not be from today.
.PP
With option
.BR -c ,
.I yesterday
copies the dump file to the current directory.
.PP
The
.I date
option selects other day's dumps, with a format of
2, 4, 6, or 8 digits of the form
.IR dd ,
.IR mmdd ,
.IR yymmdd ,
or
.IR yyyymmdd .
.PP
.I Yesterday
does not guarantee that the string it prints represents an existing file.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Back up to yesterday's MIPS binary of
.BR vc :
.IP
.EX
cd /mips/bin
yesterday -c vc
.EE
.PP
Temporarily back up to March 1's MIPS C library to see if a program
runs correctly when loaded with it:
.IP
.EX
bind `{yesterday -0301 /mips/lib/libc.a} /mips/lib/libc.a
rm v.out
mk
v.out
.EE
