.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Char
displays two square arrays of characters on the screen.  The left square shows
the first character of each 256-character page of the Unicode Standard.
The right square
shows the contents of one page.
Using button 1 or 2 to select a character in the
left square changes the right square to display the corresponding page and
displays the offset and name of the page in the upper left corner of the screen.
Selecting a character in the right square displays its hexadecimal value and
name.
In addition, any characters selected with
button 2 are added to the end of 8½'s snarf buffer.  Button 3 pops up a menu containing an
.I exit
button, whose selection must be confirmed by pressing button 3 again
and a
.I clear snarf
button that empties the snarf buffer.
.PP
The optional argument indicates which font to use (default
.BR $font ).
.PP
.I ½char
is intended for a smaller window and displays only a single
256-character panel.  Clicking button 1 on a character displays its
code and, if possible, description; button 2 works similarly, but also
writes the character to
.IR file ,
default
.B /dev/snarf
(8½'s snarf buffer), which it displays near the bottom of the
window.  Clicking button 3 selects the page corresponding to
the cursor position in the panel.  Typed characters are added to the
file, except:
backspace
deletes the last character;
control-U
clears the buffer;
control-D
exits.
.PP
.I Rschar
is the radical/stroke chart from Volume 2 of the Unicode Standard.
Flags can be used to restrict the display to one or more Asian
character sets:
.TP
.B -b
Big Five (traditional Chinese).
.TP
.B -g
GB 2312-80 (simplified Chinese).
.TP
.B -j
JIS X 0208-1990 (Japanese).
.PP
By default, all characters are shown.
Button 3 controls a menu to change flag selections.
Radicals are shown in a panel on the left side
of the window.  Clicking on a radical with button 1 or 2 brings up, on
the right, a panel of characters ordered by stroke count.  If the
window is too small to contain them all, one may scroll through
successive panels by clicking on arrows that appear at the top.
Clicking on a character with button 1 displays its code; clicking with
button 2 adds the character to the snarf buffer.  Typed characters
behave as in
.IR ½char .
.SH FILES
.B /lib/unicode
contains the names of the unicode characters.  Many characters have no name.

.SH BUGS
.I Char
needs a largish window to work properly and doesn't complain if it doesn't
get it.
