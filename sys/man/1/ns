.TH NS 1
.SH NAME
ns \- display name space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ns
[
.B -r
] [
.I pid
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ns
prints a representation of the file name space of the process with the named
.IR pid ,
or by default itself.
The output is in the form of an
.IR rc (1)
script that could, in principle, recreate the name space.
The output is produced by reading and reformatting the contents of
.BI /proc/ pid /ns .
.PP
By default,
.I ns
rewrites the names of network data files to represent the network
address that data file is connected to, for example replacing
.B /net/tcp/82/data
with
.BR tcp!123.122.121.9 .
The
.B -r
flag suppresses this rewriting.

.SH BUGS
The names of files printed by
.I ns
will be inaccurate if a file or directory it includes has been renamed.
