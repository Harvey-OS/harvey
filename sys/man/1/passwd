.TH PASSWD 1
.SH NAME
passwd, netkey \- change user password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B passwd
.PP
.B netkey
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Passwd
changes the invoker's Plan 9 password and/or APOP secret.
The Plan 9 password is used to login to a terminal while
the APOP secret is used for a number of external services:
POP3, IMAP, and VPN access.
.PP
The program first prompts for the old Plan 9 password to establish
identity.
It then prompts for changes to the password and the
secret.
New passwords and secrets must be typed twice, to forestall mistakes.
New passwords must be sufficiently hard to guess.
They may of any length greater than seven characters.
.PP
.I Netkey
uses the password to encrypt network challenges.
It is a substitute for a SecureNet box.
.PP
These commands may be run only on a terminal, to avoid
transmitting clear text passwords over the network.
