.TH PASSWD 1
.SH NAME
passwd, typepasswd, netkey \(mi change login password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B passwd
.PP
.B aux/typepasswd
.PP
.B aux/netkey
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Passwd
changes your Plan 9 password.
The program prompts for the old password and then for the new one.
The caller must supply both.
The new password must be typed twice, to forestall mistakes.
New passwords must be at least five characters long
and be sufficiently hard to guess;
passwords are not limited to eight characters.
If the command is successful,
the key in the encryption device is changed.
Since each name space group
has a separate encryption device,
keys in other name space groups are not updated.
For example, other windows will not have the new password.
To correct the problem, reboot or run
.I typepasswd
in the other windows.
.PP
.I Typepasswd
changes the key in the user's encryption device
without changing the Plan 9 password.
.PP
.I Netkey
uses the password to encrypt network challenges.
It is a substitute for a SecureNet box.
.PP
These commands should be run only on a terminal; otherwise
the password will be transmitted over a network in clear text.
