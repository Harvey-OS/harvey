.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Aquarela
listens on port 455, 137, and optionally 129 for incoming
Microsoft file-sharing protocol (also known as
.SM SMB
or
.SM CIFS\c
) requests for files and fulfills these from its namespace.
.PP
.I Aquarela's
authentication uses the Inferno/pop secret held by the auth server.
Transcoding is performed between spaces and non-breaking spaces to accommodate 
fileservers other than fossil.
Debug and log messages are appended to
.L /sys/log/aquarela
if it exists.
By default the share 
.B /
is offered, which represents the root of the local Plan 9 filesystem.
If a different name is requested by the client, then
.I 9fs
(see
.IR srv (4))
is invoked to attach that filesystem, which is then exported instead.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B -d
.I option
Enable one of many possible debugging options; see below 
.TP
.B -n
Enable vestigial NetBios support, a NetBios listener is started
to answer name queries, to register the the local host with the Local
Master Browser for the chosen workgroup. 
.I Aquarela
can not not act as a Local Master Browser, so relies on the existence
of an external one on the network, e.g. Samba's 
.IR nmbd .
This option is required to make the local machine appear in
.I Windows
machines
.IR "Network Neighbourhood" ,
however Windows machines do not need this if they map a drive directly
to the Plan 9 systems
.SM IP
address.
.TP
.B -p
Sends log messages to standard output, as well as to the log file.
.TP
.B -u
.I 0|1
Enable or disable Unicode support; since there is no code page support,
the server actually sends
.SM UTF
if this is disabled 
.TP
.B -w
.I name
Sets the workgroup (or primary domain) to name.
The default is
.SM PLAN9

request or transaction2 sub-request 
(e.g.

or

) logging is enabled for just that message type. 
.TP
.B 0xnn
A 2 digit hex constant enables debugging of the message with this
numeric id.
