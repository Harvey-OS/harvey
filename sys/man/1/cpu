.TH CPU 1
.SH NAME
cpu \- connection to cpu server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cpu
[
.B -h
.I server
]
[
.B -c
.I cmd args ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cpu
starts an
.IR rc (1)
running on the
.I server
machine, or the machine named in the
.B $cpu
environment variable if there is no
.B -h
option.
.IR Rc 's
standard input, output, and error files will be
.B /dev/cons
in the name space where the
.I cpu
command was invoked.
Normally,
.I cpu
is run in an
.IR 8½ (1)
window on a terminal, so
.IR rc
output goes to that window, and input comes from the keyboard
when that window is current.
.IR Rc 's
current directory is
the working directory of the
.I cpu
command itself.
.PP
The name space for the new
.I rc
is an analogue of the name space where the
.I cpu
command was invoked:
it is the same except for architecture-dependent bindings such as
.B /bin
and the use of fast paths to file servers, if available.
.PP
If a
.B -c
argument is present, the remainder of the command line is executed by
.I rc
on the server, and then
.I cpu
exits.
.PP
The name space is built by running
.B /usr/$user/lib/profile
with the root of the invoking name space bound to
.BR /mnt/term .
The
.B service
environment variable is set to
.BR cpu ;
the
.B cputype
and
.B objtype
environment variables reflect the server's architecture.
.SH FILES
The name space of the terminal side of the
.B cpu
command is mounted on the CPU side on directory
.BR /mnt/term .
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR rc (1) ,
.IR 8½ (1)
.SH BUGS
Binds and mounts done after the terminal
.B lib/profile
is run are not reflected in the new name space.
