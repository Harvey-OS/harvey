.I Seconds
accepts a somewhat wider range of input than just output from
.IR date (1).
The main requirement is that the date must be fully specified,
with a day of month, month and year
in any order.
The month must be an English name (or abbreviation),
not a number, and the year must contain 4 digits.
Unambiguous time-zone names are understood (i.e., not
.LR IST )
or time zones may be written as
.IR Â±hhmm .
Case is ignored.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR date (1),
.IR du (1),
.IR ctime (2)
.SH BUGS
All-numeric dates, popular in the USA, are simply ambiguous,
more so if the year is truncated to 2 digits.
