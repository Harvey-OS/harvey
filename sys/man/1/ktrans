ktrans \- language transliterator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ktrans
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ktrans
program installs itself between the keyboard and
.B /dev/cons
and transliterates typed letter
sequences into characters in languages that do not use the Latin character set.
The language is selected by typing a control character:
.TP
.B ctl-E
return to default English mode (no transliteration).
.TP
.B ctl-G
Japanese hiragana:
interpret lower-case letters as a Hepburn representation
of hiragana.
In this mode, typing
.B ctl-T
looks up the last `word' in a hiragana-kanji dictionary
and replaces it.
Subsequent
.B ctl-T
characters cycle through the possibilities.
A word is the longest immediately preceding
unbroken string of hiragana characters.
.TP
.B ctl-K
Japanese katakana.
.TP
.B ctl-R
Russian: interpret letters as Cyrillic;
the transliteration is mostly phonetic, with
.B '
for
.IR myagkij-znak
(ь),
.B ''
for
.I tverdyj-znak
(ъ)
.I yo
for ё,
.B j
for
.IR i-kratkaya
(й).
.TP
.B ctl-L
Greek.
