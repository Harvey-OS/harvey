.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sysmon
displays a rolling graph of various statistics collected by the operating
system.
The statistics may be from a remote
.IR machine .
A sample value is taken
once per second. The number in the top left corner of the graph
gives the peak value for the duration of the graph.
Lines across the
graph represent 75%, 50%, and 25% of the peak value.
Clicking a mouse button anywhere
in the window cycles through the list of parameters to monitor; an
.I option
letter sets the initial choice.
The option letters and parameters are:
.TF [t]tlbpurge
.TP
.RB [ m ] " mem 
total pages of active memory.
The memory is displayed as a fraction
of the machine's total memory.
.TP
.B 
.RB [ e ] " ether
number of packets sent and received per second.
.TP
.RB [ w ] " swap
number of valid pages on the swap device.
The swap is displayed as a
fraction of the number of swap pages configured by the machine.
.TP
.RB [ c ] " contxt
number of process context switches per second.
.TP
.RB [ i ] " intr
number of interrupts per second.
.TP
.RB [ f ] " fault
number of memory faults per second.
.TP
.RB [ t ] " tlbmiss
number of translation look-aside buffer misses per second.
.TP
.RB [ p ] " tlbpurge
number of translation lookaside buffer flushes per second.
.TP
.RB [ l ] " load
system load average.
The load is computed as a running average of
the number of processes ready to run multiplied by 1000 to give
some precision.
.PP
The
.I stats
program is invoked by
.I sysmon
to display the graph.
