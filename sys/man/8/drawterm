.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Drawterm
is
.I not
a Plan 9 program.
It is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use
to establish graphical
.IR cpu (1)
connections with Plan 9 CPU servers.
Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does,
.I drawterm
serves its local name space
as well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen)
to a remote CPU server, which mounts this name space
on
.B /mnt/term
and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell
to start
.IR rio (1).
.PP
By default,
drawterm
uses the CPU server
.B $cpu
or
.BR cpu .
and the authentication server
.B $auth
or
.BR auth .
The
.BR -a ,
.BR -c ,
and
.B -s
options specify alternate authentication, CPU and
.I secstore
servers,
respectively.
(Edit the source to set appropriate local defaults.)
.PP
.I Cmd
is a command to be executed remotely.
Options
.LR e ,
.LR k ,
and
.L u
have the same meaning as in
.IR cpu (1).
.PP
Drawterm has been ported to
FreeBSD,
Irix,
Linux,
NetBSD,
and
Windows.
Binaries can be downloaded from
.BR http://swtch.com/drawterm/ .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Drawterm prints most diagnostics in its own window.

.SH BUGS
Although at first
.I drawterm
may seem like a Plan 9 terminal, in fact it is just a way to provide a CPU server
with some terminal devices.
The difference is important because one cannot run terminal-resident programs
when using
.IR drawterm .
The illusion can be improved by delicate adjustments in
.BR /usr/$user/lib/profile .
.PP
It would be nice to be able to change the default servers
without recompiling.
