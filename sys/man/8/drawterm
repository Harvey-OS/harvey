.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Drawterm
is
.I not
a Plan 9 program.
It is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use
to establish graphical 
.IR cpu (1)
connections with Plan 9 CPU servers.
Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does, 
.I drawterm
serves its local name space
as well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen)
to a remote CPU server, which mounts this name space
on 
.B /mnt/term
and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell
to start
.IR rio (1).
.PP
By default, 
drawterm
uses the CPU server
.B CPUSERV
and the authentication server
.BR AUTHSERV .
The 
.B -a
and
.B -c
options specify alternate servers.
(Edit the source to set appropriate local values  for the variables
.B AUTHSERV
and
.BR CPUSERV ).
.PP
On Windows systems, the file system served by the
terminal (and mounted on
.BR /mnt/term )
is the tree rooted at
.BR c:/ .
The
.B -r
option specifies a different file system root.
In Windows, the depth of the virtual screen
provided by
drawterm
matches the depth of the actual screen.
To present a screen with a different depth, use the
.B -d
option.
Both options do nothing on non-Windows systems.
.PP
The 
.B -n
option causes 
drawterm to prompt for authentication via
.IR netkey -style
challenge/response rather than using
the password-based protocol typically used
by terminals.
.PP
By default, drawterm queues mouse events to
guard against lost events due to network latency.
The
.B -m
option turns this behavior off.
.PP
Drawterm has been ported to
Digital Unix,
Irix,
Linux,
Solaris,
and
Windows.
Binaries are kept in
.BR /sys/src/cmd/unix/drawterm/bin .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The Unix versions of drawterm print diagnostics
to standard error.
The Windows version displays message boxes.

.SH BUGS
Although at first
.I drawterm
may seem like a Plan 9 terminal, in fact it is just a way to provide a CPU server
with some terminal devices.
The difference is important because one cannot run terminal-resident programs
when using
.IR drawterm .
The illusion can be improved by delicate adjustments in
.BR /usr/$user/lib/profile .
.PP
It would be nice to be able to change the default servers
without recompiling.
