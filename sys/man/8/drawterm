.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Drawterm
is
.I not
a Plan 9 program.
It is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use
to establish graphical 
.IR cpu (1)
connections with Plan 9 CPU servers.
Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does, 
.I drawterm
serves its local name space
as well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen)
to a remote CPU server, which mounts this name space
on 
.B /mnt/term
and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell
to start
.IR rio (1).
.PP
By default, 
drawterm
uses the CPU server
.B $cpu
or
.BR cpu .
and the authentication server
.B $auth
or
.BR auth .
The 
.B -a
and
.B -c
options specify alternate servers.
(Edit the source to set appropriate local defaults.)
.PP
Drawterm has been ported to
FreeBSD,
Irix,
Linux,
NetBSD,
and
Windows.
Binaries can be downloaded from
.BR http://swtch.com/drawterm/ .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.SH BUGS
Although at first
.I drawterm
may seem like a Plan 9 terminal, in fact it is just a way to provide a CPU server
with some terminal devices.
The difference is important because one cannot run terminal-resident programs
when using
.IR drawterm .
The illusion can be improved by delicate adjustments in
.BR /usr/$user/lib/profile .
.PP
It would be nice to be able to change the default servers
without recompiling.
