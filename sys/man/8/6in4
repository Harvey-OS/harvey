.SH DESCRIPTION
.I 6in4
sets up and maintains a tunnel of IPv6 traffic through an IPv4 connection.
.I Local6
and
.I mask
define the IPv6 address and subnet of the near end of the tunnel
.RI ( mask
defaults to
.L /128
for a single-host
tunnel),
.I remote4
is the IPv4 address of the far end of the tunnel
(must be given explicitly for a configured tunnel, or
defaults to the anycast address 192.88.99.1 for
.IR 6to4 ),
and
.I remote6
is the IPv6 address of the far end of the tunnel
(used as the point-to-point destination for routing, and
defaults to a link-local address constructed from
.IR remote4 ).
.PP
Supply
.B -g
to use the tunnel as the default route for global IPv6 addresses.
.B -x
uses the network mounted at
.I netmtpt
instead of
.LR /net .
.SH EXAMPLES
If your public IPv6 address is
.LR 1.2.3.4,
you can start a 6to4 tunnel simply with
.IP
.EX
6in4 -g 2002:0102:0304::1/48
.EE
.PP
If you use a tunnel broker at address
.LR 5.6.7.8 , configured to
give you a
.L /64
subnet with address
.LR 2001:1122:3344:5566:: ,
you can start the tunnel with
.IP
.EX
6in4 -g 2001:1122:3344:5566::/64 5.6.7.8

.SH BUGS
Needs a kernel with an
.I ipmux
driver.
.PP
The tunnel client filters addresses fairly conservatively in both directions.
However it's not watertight,
and may be flakey in other ways so don't put too much trust in it.
