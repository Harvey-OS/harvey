.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ipconfig
binds a device interface (default
.BR /net/ether0 )
to a mounted IP stack (default
.BR /net )
and configures the interface with a local address, a
mask, and a remote address.  The addresses can be specified
in the command line or obtained via DHCP.  If DHCP is
requested, it will also obtain the addresses of DNS
servers, NTP servers, gateways, a Plan 9 file server,
and a Plan 9 authentication server.  If this is the first
non-loopback
interface on the IP stack, the information will be
written to
.B /net/ndb
in the form of an
.IR ndb (8)
entry.
.PP
.I Type
may be
.BR ether ,
.BR ppp ,
or
.BR gbe .
The
.B gbe
type is equivalent to
.B ether
except that it allows jumbo packets.
For
.B ppp
the device can be any byte stream device.
.PP
The verb (default
.IR add )
determines the action performed.  The verbs are:
.TP
.B add
if the device is not bound to the IP stack, bind it.
Add the given local address, mask, and remote address to the interface.
An interface may have multiple addresses.
.TP
.B remove
remove the address from the device interface.
.TP
.B unbind
unbind the device interface and all its addresses from the
IP stack.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B D
turn on debugging.
.TP
.B N
look in /lib/ndb for the IP parameters.  This only works if the
interface is an ethernet.  It uses the ethernet address to find
a matching entry.
.TP
.B G
use only generic DHCP options.  Without this option,
.I ipconfig
adds to requests a Vendor Class option with value
.BI plan9_$ cputype
and also requests vendor specific options 128 and 129 which we
interpret as the Plan 9 file server and auth server.
Replies to these options contain a list of IP addresses for possible
file servers and auth servers.
.TP
.B p
write configuration information to
.BR /net/ndb ,
even if other network interfaces are already configured
.TP
.B P
do not write configuration information to
.BR /net/ndb ,
even if this is the first network interface to be configured
.TP
.B b
the baud rate to use on a serial line
when configuring
.BR PPP .
.TP
.B c
write the control string
.I ctl
to the ethernet device control file before starting to configure it.
May be repeated to specify multiple control writes.
.TP
.B d
use DHCP to determine any unspecified configuration parameters.
.TP
.B g
the default gateway.
.TP
.B h
the hostname to add to DHCP requests.  Some DHCP
servers, such as the one used by COMCAST, will not respond
unless a correct hostname is in the request.
.TP
.B m
the maximum IP packet size to use on this
interface.
.TP
.B n
determine parameters but don't configure the interface.
.TP
.B r
by default, 
.I ipconfig
exits after trying DHCP for 15 seconds with no answer.
This option directs
.I ipconfig
instead to fork a background
process that keeps trying forever.
.TP
.B x
use the IP stack mounted at
.I netmtpt
instead of at
.BR /net .
.TP
.B o
adds
.I dhcpoption
to the list of paramters requested of the DHCP server.  The
result will appear in
.B /net/ndb
should this be the first interface.  The known options are:

  ipmask, timeoff, ipgw, time, name, dns, log, cookie,
  lpr, impress, rl, sys, bflen, dumpfile, dom, swap,
  rootpath, extpath, ipforward, nonlocal, policyfilter,
  maxdatagram, ttl, pathtimeout, pathplateau, mtu,
  subnetslocal, baddr, discovermask, supplymask,
  discoverrouter, rs, staticroutes, trailerencap,
  arptimeout, etherencap, tcpttl, tcpka, tcpkag,
  nisdomain, ni, ntp, netbiosns, netbiosdds,
  netbiostype, netbiosscope, xfont, xdispmanager,
  nisplusdomain, nisplus, homeagent, smtp, pop3, nntp,
  www, finger, irc, st, stdar, , ipaddr, lease,
  overload, type, serverid, params, message, maxmsg,
  renewaltime, rebindingtime, vendorclass, clientid,
  tftp, bootfile

.EE
The options
.BR ipmask ,
.BR ipgw ,
.BR dns ,
.BR sys ,
and
.B ntp
are always requested.
.TP
.B O
addresses specified on the command line override those obtained
via DHCP.
A command line addresse of 0 implies no override.
.PD
.PP
If DHCP is requested, a process is forked
off to renew the lease before it
runs out.  If the lease does run out, this
process will remove any configured addresses
from the interface.
.PP
.I Rip
runs the routing protocol RIP.
It listens for RIP packets on connected networks and
updates the kernel routing tables.
The options are:
.TP
.B b
broadcasts routing information onto the networks.
.TP
.B n
gathers routing information but doesn't write to the
route table.  This is useful with
.B \-d
to debug a network.
.TP
.B x
use the IP stack mounted at
.I netmtpt
instead of at
.BR /net .
.TP
.B d
turn on (voluminous) debugging.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
Configure Ethernet 0 as the primary IP interface.
Get all addresses via DHCP.  Start up a connection server
and DNS resolver for this IP stack.
.IP
.EX
% bind -b '#l0' /net
% bind -a '#I0' /net
% ip/ipconfig
% ndb/cs
% ndb/dns -r
.EE
.PP
Add a second address to the stack.
.IP
.EX
% ip/ipconfig ether /net/ether0 add 12.1.1.2 255.255.255.0
.EE
.PP
At Lucent our primary IP stack is always to the company's internal
firewall-protected network.  The following creates an external
IP stack to directly access the outside Internet.  Note that the
connection server uses a different set of
.I ndb
files.  This prevents us from confusing inside and outside name/address
bindings.
.IP
.EX
% bind -b '#l1' /net.alt
% bind -b '#I1' /net.alt
% ip/ipconfig -x /net.alt -g 204.178.31.1 ether /net.alt/ether1\\
	204.178.31.6 255.255.255.0
% ndb/cs -x /net.alt -f /lib/ndb/external
% ndb/dns -sx /net.alt -f /lib/ndb/external
% aux/listen -d /rc/bin/service.alt /net.alt/tcp
% aux/listen -d /rc/bin/service.alt /net.alt/il
