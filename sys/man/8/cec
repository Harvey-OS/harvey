.I interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cec
command uses raw Ethernet frames to connect to a CEC
server for console access.  All clients share the same session.  Coraid
appliances are currently the only CEC servers.
.PP
A
.I cec
process starts by probing the specified network interface
(e.g.,
.LR /net/ether0 )
for available CEC servers.  If the shelf address of the server is
specified with the
.B -s
flag, the connection will
proceed immediately upon discovery of the first CEC server
with this shelf address.  Otherwise, a selection prompt
will be displayed showing the discovered CEC servers
available for communication.  If no servers are discovered,
.I cec
exits.

ID number printed in the leftmost column.
.PP
Once connected to a CEC server, entering the escape sequence
will drop the user into an escape prompt where the user may
type
.L q
to quit the connection,
.L i
to send the escape sequence
across the connection, or
.L .
to continue the connection.
The escape sequence is printed on connection.
.PP
If the
.B -s
option is used,
.I cec
will exit upon closing the connection.
Otherwise,
.I cec
will return to the selection prompt upon connection close.

.SH BUGS
The CEC protocol should be integrated with the console server.
The arbitration between the keyboard and network is suboptimal.
