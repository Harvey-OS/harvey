.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Smtp
sends the mail message from standard input
to the users
.I rcpt-list
on the host at network address
.I address 
using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
The options are:
.TP
.B -d
turn on debugging to standard error.
.TP
.B -a
authenticate ourself to the server if the server
supports PLAIN authentication and allows us to first
start up an encrypted TLS connection
.TP
.B -s
if the server supports the ESMTP extension to use TLS encryption, turn it on for
this session.  See RFC3207 for details.
.TP
.B -a
if the server supports the ESMTP extension to use TLS encryption, turn it
on.  If the server also supports the PLAIN (user + password) authentication,
authenticate to the server using a password from
.IR factotum (4).  See RFC's 3207 and 2554.
.TP
.B -u
specify a user name to be used in authentication.  The default name is
the current login id.
.TP
.B -h
use
.I host
as the local system name;
it may be fully-qualified or not.  If not
specified, it will default to the contents of
.BR /dev/sysname .
.TP
.B -f
just filter the converted message to standard
output rather than sending it.
.TP
.B -g
makes
.I gateway
the system to pass the message to if smtp can't
find an address or MX entry for the destination system.
.PD
.PP
Finally if
.I .domain
is given, it is appended to the end of any unqaulified system names
in the envelope or header.
.PP
.I Smtpd
receives a message using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
Standard input and output are the protocol connection.
SMTP authentication by
.I login
and
.I cram-md5
protocols is supported; authenticated connections are permitted to relay.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B -d
turns on debugging output to standard error.
.TP
.B -r
turns on forward DNS validation of non-trusted sender address.
.TP
.B -g
turns on grey/white list processing.  All mail is rejected (with a
retry code) unless the sender's IP address is on the whitelist,
.BR /mail/lib/whitelist ,
an append only file.
Addresses can be added to the whitelist by the administrator.  However,
the usual way for addresses to be added is by smtpd itself.  Whenever,
a message is received and the sender's address isn't on the whitelist,
.B smtpd
first looks for the file,
.B /mail/grey/<remote ipaddr>/<local ipaddr>/<recipient> .
If that file exists, the remote address is added to the whitelist.  If
not, the file is created and the mail is rejected with a 'try again'
code.  The expectation is that spammers will not retry and that others
will.
.TP
.B -f
prevents relaying from non-trusted networks.
It also tags messages from non-trusted sites when they deliver mail
from an address in a domain we believe we represent.
.TP
.B -n
specifies the name of the network directory assigned to the incoming connection.
This is used to determine the peer IP address.  If this flag is not
specified, the peer address is determined using standard input.
.TP
.B -h
specifies the receiving domain.  If this flag is not specified, the
receiving domain is inferred from the host name.
.TP
.B -s
causes copies of blocked messages to be saved in a sub-directory of
.BR /mail/queue.dump .
.TP
.B -k
causes connections from the host at
the IP address,
.IR evilipaddr ,
to be dropped at program startup.  Multiple addresses
can be specified with several
.B -k
options.  This option should be used carefully;
it is intended to lessen the effects of denial of
service attacks or broken mailers which continually
connect.  The connections are not logged and the
remote system is not notified via the protocol.
.TP
.B -c
specifies a certificate to use for TLS.  Without this
option, the capability to start TLS will not be advertised.
.TP
.B -a
requires that all clients authenticate to be able to send mail.
.TP
.B -p
permits clients to authenticate using protocols which transfer
the password in the clear, e.g.
.I login
protocol. This should only be used if the connection has
previously encrypted using e.g.
.IR tlssrv (8).
.PP
.I Smtpd
is normally run by a network listener such as
.IR listen (8).
Most of the command line options are more conveniently
specified in the smtpd configuration file stored in
.BR /mail/lib/smtpd.conf .
