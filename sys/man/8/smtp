.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Smtp
sends the mail message from standard input
to the users
.I rcpt-list
on the host at network address
.I address
using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
The options are:
.TF -
.PD
.TP
.B -a
if the server supports PLAIN or LOGIN authentication,
authenticate to the server using a password from
.IR factotum (4).
See RFCs 3207 and 2554.
This option implies
.BR -s .
.TP
.B -A
autistic server: don't wait for an SMTP greeting banner
but immediately send a
.L NOOP
command to provoke the server into responding.
.TP
.B -b
ignore
.I busted-mx
when trying MX hosts.
May be repeated.
.TP
.B -d
turn on debugging to standard error.
.TP
.B -f
just filter the converted message to standard
output rather than sending it.
.TP
.B -g
makes
.I gateway
the system to pass the message to if
.I smtp
can't find an address nor MX entry for the destination system.
.TP
.B -h
use
.I host
as the local system name;
it may be fully-qualified or not.  If not
specified, it will default to the contents of
.BR /dev/sysname .
.TP
.B -i
under
.BR -a ,
authenticate even if we can't start TLS.
.TP
.B -p
ping: just verify that the users named in the
.I rcpt-list
are valid users at
.IR destaddr ;
don't send any mail.
.TP
.B -s
if the server supports the ESMTP extension to use TLS encryption, turn it on for
this session.  See RFC3207 for details.
.TP
.B -u
specify a user name to be used in authentication.  The default name is
the current login id.
.PD
.PP
Finally if
.I .domain
is given, it is appended to the end of any unqualified system names
in the envelope or header.
.
.PP
.I Smtpd
receives a message using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
Standard input and output are the protocol connection.
SMTP authentication by
.I login
and
.I cram-md5
protocols is supported; authenticated connections are permitted to relay.
.PP
The options are:
.TF -
.PD
.TP
.B -a
requires that all clients authenticate to be able to send mail.
.TP
.B -c
specifies a certificate to use for TLS.  Without this
option, the capability to start TLS will not be advertised.
.TP
.B -d
turns on debugging output,
with each connection's output going to a uniquely-named file in
.BR /sys/log/smtpdb .
.TP
.B -D
sleeps for 15 seconds usually at the start of the SMTP dialogue;
this deters some spammers.
Connections from Class A networks frequented by spammers will incur
a longer delay.
.TP
.B -f
prevents relaying from non-trusted networks.
It also tags messages from non-trusted sites when they deliver mail
from an address in a domain we believe we represent.
.TP
.B -g
turns on grey/white list processing.  All mail is rejected (with a
retry code) unless the sender's IP address is on the whitelist,
.BR /mail/grey/whitelist ,
an append only file.
Addresses can be added to the whitelist by the administrator.  However,
the usual way for addresses to be added is by
.I smtpd
itself.
Whenever a message is received and the sender's address isn't on the whitelist,
.I smtpd
first looks for the file
.BI /mail\%/grey\%/tmp\%/\| local\% /\| remote\% /\| recipient\fP,
where
.I local
and
.I remote
are IP addresses of the local and remote systems, respectively.
If it exists and was created more than a few minutes go,
the remote address is added to the whitelist.
If not, the file is created and the mail is rejected with a `try again' code.
The expectation is that spammers will not retry for more than a few minutes
and that others will.
.TP
.B -h
specifies the receiving domain.  If this flag is not specified, the
receiving domain is inferred from the host name.
.TP
.B -k
causes connections from the host at
the IP address,
.IR evilipaddr ,
to be dropped at program startup.  Multiple addresses
can be specified with several
.B -k
options.  This option should be used carefully;
it is intended to lessen the effects of denial of
service attacks or broken mailers which continually
connect.  The connections are not logged and the
remote system is not notified via the protocol.
.TP
.B -m
set the
.I mailer
to which
.I smtpd
passes a received message.
The default is
.BR /bin/upas/send .
.TP
.B -n
specifies the name of the network directory assigned to the incoming connection.
This is used to determine the peer IP address.  If this flag is not
specified, the peer address is determined using standard input.
.TP
.B -p
permits clients to authenticate using protocols which transfer
the password in the clear, e.g.
.I login
protocol. This should only be used if the connection has
previously encrypted using e.g.
.IR tlssrv (8).
.TP
.B -r
turns on forward DNS validation of non-trusted sender address.
.TP
.B -s
causes copies of blocked messages to be saved in a sub-directory of
.BR /mail/queue.dump .
.PP
.I Smtpd
is normally run by a network listener such as
.IR listen (8).
Most of the command line options are more conveniently
specified in the smtpd configuration file stored in
.BR /mail/lib/smtpd.conf .
