.TH STATS 8
.SH NAME
stats \- display graphs of system activity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stats
[
.BI - option

[
.I machine
\&...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Stats
displays a rolling graph of various statistics collected by the operating
system and updated once per second.
The statistics may be from a remote
.I machine
or multiple
.IR machines ,
whose graphs will appear in adjacent columns.
The columns are labeled by the machine names and the number
of processors on the machine if it is a multiprocessor.
.PP
The right mouse button presents a menu to enable and disable the display
of various statistics; by default,
.I stats
begins by showing the load average on the executing machine.
The
.I options
choose the initial set to display:
.TF [t]tlbpurge
.TP
.B "c context
number of process context switches per second.
.TP
.B 
.B "e ether
total number of packets sent and received per second.
.TP
.B 
.B "E etherin,out
number of packets sent and received per second, displayed as separate graphs.
.TP
.B "f fault
number of page faults per second.
.TP
.B "i intr
number of interrupts per second.
.TP
.B "l load
(default) system load average.
The load is computed as a running average of
the number of processes ready to run, multiplied by 1000.
.TP
.B "m mem 
total pages of active memory.
The graph displays the fraction
of the machine's total memory in use.
.TP
.B 
.B "n etherin,out,err
number of packets sent and received per second, and total number of errors, displayed as separate graphs.
.TP
.B "p tlbpurge
number of translation lookaside buffer flushes per second.
.TP
.B "s syscall
number of system calls per second.
.TP
.B "t tlbmiss
number of translation lookaside buffer misses per second.
.TP
.B "w swap
number of valid pages on the swap device.
The swap is displayed as a
fraction of the number of swap pages configured by the machine.
.PD
.PP
The graphs are plotted with time on the horizontal axis.
The vertical axes range from 0 to 1000 times the number of processors on the machine.
The only exceptions are
memory
and swap space,
which display fractions of the total available, and the Ethernet error count,
which goes from 0 to 10.
If the value of the parameter is too large for the visible range, its value is shown
in decimal in the upper left corner of the graph.
