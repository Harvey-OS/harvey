.SH NAME
stats \- display graphs of system activity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stats
[
.BI - option

[

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Stats
displays a rolling graph of various statistics collected by the operating
system and updated once per second.
The statistics may be from a remote
.I machine
or multiple
.IR machines ,
whose graphs will appear in adjacent columns.
The columns are labeled by the machine names and the number
of processors on the machine if it is a multiprocessor.
.PP
The right mouse button presents a menu to enable and disable the display
of various statistics; by default,
.I stats
begins by showing the load average on the executing machine.
.PP
The
lower-case
.I options
choose the initial set to display:
.TF [t]tlbpurge
.TP
.B "b battery
percentage battery life remaining.
.TP
.B "c context
number of process context switches per second.
.TP
.B 
.B "e ether
total number of packets sent and received per second.
.TP
.B 
.B "E etherin,out
number of packets sent and received per second, displayed as separate graphs.
.TP
.B "f fault
number of page faults per second.
.TP
.B "i intr
number of interrupts per second.
.TP
.B "l load
(default) system load average.
The load is computed as a running average of
the number of processes ready to run, multiplied by 1000.
.TP
.B "m mem 
total pages of active memory.
The graph displays the fraction
of the machine's total memory in use.
.TP
.B 
.B "n etherin,out,err
number of packets sent and received per second, and total number of errors, displayed as separate graphs.
.TP
.B "p tlbpurge
number of translation lookaside buffer flushes per second.
.TP
.B "s syscall
number of system calls per second.
.TP
.B "t tlbmiss
number of translation lookaside buffer misses per second.
.TP
.B "w swap
number of valid pages on the swap device.
The swap is displayed as a
fraction of the number of swap pages configured by the machine.
.PD
.PP
The graphs are plotted with time on the horizontal axis.
The vertical axes range from 0 to 1000 times the number of processors on the machine.
The only exceptions are
memory
and swap space,
which display fractions of the total available, and the Ethernet error count,
which goes from 0 to 10.
If the value of the parameter is too large for the visible range, its value is shown
in decimal in the upper left corner of the graph.
.PP
Upper-case options control details of the display.
All graphs are affected; there is no mechanism to
affect only one graph.
.TP
.BI -S " scale
Sets a scale factor for the displays.  A value of 2, for example,
means that the highest value plotted will be twice as large as the default.
.TP
.B -L
Plot all graphs with logarithmic
.I y
axes.
The graph is plotted so the maximum value that would be displayed on
a linear graph is 2/3 of the way up the
.I y
axis and the total range of the graph is a factor of 1000; thus the
.I y
origin is 1/100 of the default maximum value and the top of the graph is
10 times the default maximum.
.TP
.B -Y
If the display is large enough to show them,
place value markers along the
.I y
axes of the graphs.
Since one set of markers serves for all machines across the display,
the values in the markers disregard scaling factors due to multiple processors
on the machines. On a graph for a multiprocessor,
the displayed values will be larger
than the markers indicate.
The markers appear along the right, and the markers
show values appropriate to the rightmost machine; this only
matters for graphs such as memory that have machine-specific
maxima.
