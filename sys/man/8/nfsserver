.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs collectively provide NFS access to Plan 9 file servers.
.IR Nfsserver ,
.IR pcnfsd ,
and
.I portmapper
run on a Plan 9 CPU server, and should be started in that order.
All users on client machines have the
access privileges of the Plan 9 user
.LR none .
Currently only NFS version 2 is served.
.PP
The
.I rpc-options
are all intended for debugging:
.nr zz \w'\f5-a\f2 addr'+2n/1n
.TP \n(zz
.B -r
Reject: answer all RPC requests by returning the
.B AUTH_TOOWEAK
error.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose: show all RPC calls and internal program state, including 9P messages.
(In any case, the program creates a file
.BI /srv/ name .chat
where
.I name
is that of the program; echoing
.L 1
or
.L 0
into this file sets or clears the
.B -v
flag dynamically.)
.TP
.B -D
Debug: show all RPC messages (at a lower level than
.BR -v ).
This flag may be repeated to get more detail.
.TP
.B -C
Turn off caching: do not answer RPC requests using the
RPC reply cache.
.PP
The
.I nfs-options
are:
.TP \n(zz
.BI -a " addr"
Set up NFS service for the 9P server at network address
.IR addr .
.TP
.BI -f " file"
Set up NFS service for the 9P server at
.I file
(typically an entry in
.BR /srv ).
.TP
.B -n
Do not allow per-user authentication
(default and mandatory).
.TP
.BI -c " file"
.I File
contains the uid/gid map configuration.  It is read at startup
and subsequently every hour (or if
.L c
is echoed into
.BR /srv/nfsserver.chat ).
Blank lines or lines beginning with
.L #
are ignored; lines beginning with
.L !
are executed as commands; otherwise lines contain four fields
separated by white space: a regular expression (in the notation of
.IR regexp (6))
for a class of servers, a regular expression for
a class of clients, a file of user id's (in the format of a Unix
password file), and a file of group id's (same format).
.TP
.B -s
Expect a network connection on file descriptor 1
instead of listening for incoming calls.
.TP
.B -t
Listen for incoming TCP calls, rather than UDP calls.
.PP
NFS clients must be in the Plan 9
.B /lib/ndb
database.
The machine name is deduced from the IP address via
.BR ndb/query .
The machine name specified in the NFS Unix credentials
is completely ignored.
.PP
.I Pcnfsd
is a toy program that authorizes PC-NFS clients.  All clients
are mapped to uid=1, gid=1
.RB ( daemon
on most systems) regardless of name or password.
.SH EXAMPLES
A simple
.B /lib/ndb/nfs
might contain:
.PP
.EX
!9fs tcp!ivy
\&.+  [^.]+\e.cvrd\e.hall\e.edu  /n/ivy/etc/passwd  /n/ivy/etc/group
.EE
.PP
A typical entry in
.B /rc/bin/cpurc
might be:
.PP
.EX
aux/nfsserver -a tcp!pie -a tcp!yoshimi -c /lib/ndb/nfs
aux/pcnfsd
aux/portmapper
.EE
.PP
Assuming the CPU server's name is
.BR eduardo ,
the mount commands on the client would be:
.PP
.EX
/etc/mount -o soft,intr eduardo:pie /n/pie
/etc/mount -o soft,intr eduardo:yoshimi /n/yoshimi
.EE
.PP
Note that a single instance of
.I nfsserver
may provide access to several 9P servers.
.SH FILES
.TF /lib/ndb/nfs
.TP
.B /lib/ndb/nfs
List of uid/gid maps.
.TP
.B /sys/log/nfs
Log file.

.SH BUGS
It would be nice to provide authentication for users, but Unix systems
provide too low a level of security to be trusted in a Plan 9 world.
