.TH LP 8 
.SH NAME
lp \- PostScript preprocessors
.SH DESCRIPTION
These files reside in
.B /sys/lib/lp/process
and provide an interface to PostScript conversion programs that can be found in
.BR /sys/lib/postscript/bin/$cputype .
These preprocessors may be selected with the
.BI -p process
After each processor description, there is a list of
.I lp
options to which the processor responds.
.TF \fIp9bitpost\fP
.TP
.I generic
is the default preprocessor.
It uses
.IR file (1)
to determine the type of input and executes the correct
preprocessor for a given (input, printer) pair.
.TP
.I post
passes PostScript through adding option patches for paper tray information.
This does not always work with PostScript generated on other systems.
.TP
.I noproc
passes files through untouched.
.TP
.I ppost
converts a text file to PostScript.
.RB [ DLcfilmnorxy ]
.TP
.I dpost
converts a troff output file to PostScript.
.RB [ DLcimnorxy ]
.TP
.I dvipost
converts a TeX output file to PostScript.
.RB [ Lcinor ]
.TP
.I p9bitpost
converts a Plan 9 bitmap
.br
(i.e. 
.BR /dev/screen ,
.BR /dev/window ,
.BR /dev/windows/*/window )
to PostScript.
.RB [ Lm ]
.TP
.I tpost
converts Tektronix 4014 plot codes to PostScript.
.RB [ Lcimnorxy ]
.TP
.I hpost
adds a header page to the beginning of a PostScript printer
job so that it may be separated from other jobs in the output bin.
The header has the image of the jobs owner from the directory of faces.
Page reversal is also done in this processor.

.SH BUGS
The
.I file
command is not always smart enough to deal with certain file
types.
There are PostScript conversion programs in
.B /sys/lib/postscript/bin/$cputype
that do not have preprocessors to drive them.
