.TH LP 8 
.SH NAME
lp \- PostScript preprocessors
.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs are part of the
.IR lp (1)
suite.
Each corresponds to a
.I process
in the
.BI -p process
option of
.I lp
and exists as an
.IR rc (1)
script in
.B /sys/lib/lp/process
that provides an interface to a PostScript conversion program in
.BR /$cputype/bin/aux .
The list of processors follows;
after each description is a bracketed list of
.I lp
options to which the processor responds:
.TF \fIp9bitpost\fP
.TP
.I dpost
converts
.IR troff (1)
output for device
.SM post
to PostScript.
This is used for files troff'ed on our
.SM UNIX
systems that do not handle
.SM UTF
characters.
.RB [ DLcimnorxy ]
.TP
.I dvipost
converts
.IR tex (1)
output to PostScript.
.RB [ Lcinor ]
.TP
.I g3post
converts CCITT Group 3 FAX data to PostScript.
.RB [ DLm ]
.TP
.I gifpost
converts GIF image data to PostScript.
.RB [ DLm ]
.TP
.I generic
is the default processor.
It uses
.IR file (1)
to determine the type of input and executes the correct
processor for a given (input, printer) pair.
.TP
.I hpost
adds a header page to the beginning of a PostScript printer
job so that it may be separated from other jobs in the output bin.
The header has the image of the job's owner from the directory of faces (see
.IR face (6)).
Page reversal is also done in this processor.
.TP
.I jpgpost
converts JPEG image data to PostScript.
.RB [ DLm ]
.TP
.I noproc
passes files through untouched.
.TP
.I p9bitpost
.na
converts a Plan 9 image to PostScript, such as
.B /dev/screen
for the whole screen,
.B /dev/window
for that window's data,
and
.B /dev/wsys/.../window
for some other window's data.
.RB [ DLm ]
.ad
.TP
.I pdfpost
converts PDF data to PostScript.
.TP
.I post
passes PostScript through, adding option patches for paper tray information.
This does not always work with PostScript generated on other systems.
.TP
.I ppost
converts
.SM UTF
text to PostScript.
.RB [ DLcfilmnorxy ]
.TP
.I tr2post
converts
.IR troff (1)
output for device
.SM utf
(the default) to PostScript.
See
.B /sys/lib/troff/font/devutf
directory for troff font width table descriptions.
See also the
.B /sys/lib/postscript/troff
directory for mappings of
troff
.SM UTF
character space to PostScript
font space.

.SH BUGS
The
.I file
command is not always smart enough to deal with certain file
types.
There are PostScript conversion programs that do not have processors to drive them.
