.TH LP 8 
.SH NAME
lp \- PostScript preprocessors
.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs are part of the
.IR lp (1)
suite.
Each corresponds to a
.I process
in the
.BI -p process
option of
.I lp
and exists as an
.IR rc (1)
script in
.B /sys/lib/lp/process
that provides an interface to a PostScript conversion program in
.BR /$cputype/bin/aux .
The list of processors follows;
after each description is a bracketed list of
.I lp
options to which the processor responds:
.TF \fIp9bitpost\fP
.TP
.I generic
is the default processor.
It uses
.IR file (1)
to determine the type of input and executes the correct
processor for a given (input, printer) pair.
.TP
.I post
passes PostScript through, adding option patches for paper tray information.
This does not always work with PostScript generated on other systems.
.TP
.I noproc
passes files through untouched.
.TP
.I ppost
converts UTF text to PostScript.
.RB [ DLcfilmnorxy ]
.TP
.I dvipost
converts
.IR tex (1)
output to PostScript.
.RB [ Lcinor ]
.TP
.I g3post
converts CCITT Group 3 FAX data to PostScript.
.TP
.I p9bitpost
.na
converts a Plan 9 bitmap such as
.B /dev/window
to PostScript.
.RB [ Lm ]
.ad
.TP
.I tr2post
converts
.IR troff (1)
output for device UTF (the default) to PostScript.
.RB [ DLcimnorxy ]
.TP
.I hpost
adds a header page to the beginning of a PostScript printer
job so that it may be separated from other jobs in the output bin.
The header has the image of the job's owner from the directory of faces (see
.IR face (6)).
Page reversal is also done in this processor.

.SH BUGS
The
.I file
command is not always smart enough to deal with certain file
types.
There are PostScript conversion programs that do not have processors to drive them.
