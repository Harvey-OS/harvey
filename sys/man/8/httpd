.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Httpd
serves the
.I webroot
directory of the file system described by
.I namespace
(default
.BR /lib/namespace.httpd ),
using version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol.
It announces the service
.I srvaddr
(default
.BR tcp!*!http ),
and listens for incoming calls.
.PP
.I Httpd
supports only the GET and HEAD methods of the HTTP protocol;
some magic programs support POST as well.
Persistent connections are supported for HTTP/1.1 or later clients;
all connections close after a magic command is executed.
The Content-type
(default application/octet-stream)
and Content-encoding
(default binary)
of a file are determined by looking for suffixes of the file name in
.BR /sys/lib/mimetype .
.PP
Each requested URI is looked up in a redirection table, read from
.BR /sys/lib/httpd.rewrite .
If a prefix of the URI matches a redirection path,
the URI is rewritten using a replacement path,
and a redirect is sent to the HTTP client.
If the replacement path does not specify a server name,
and the request has no explicit host,
then
.I domain
is the host name used in the redirection.
.PP
The redirection table also maps a URI into an authentication realm.
If a prefix of the URI matches a realm,
the server negotiates a basic authentication with the client.
The client's credentials are checked by calling
.B httpauth
(see
.IR auth (2)),
passing the realm and the client's supplied password as arguments.
.PP
If the requested URI begins with
.BI  /magic/ server /\f1,
.I httpd
executes the file
.BI /bin/ip/httpd/ server
to finish servicing the request.
.IR Method
and
.IR version
are those received on the first line of the request.
.I Uri
is the remaining portion of the requested URI.
.I Inbuf
contains the rest of the bytes read by the server,
and
.I netdir
is the network directory for the connection.
There are routines for processing command arguments,
parsing headers, etc. in the httpd library,
.BR /sys/src/cmd/ip/httpd/libhttpd.a.$O .
See
.B httpd.h
in that directory and existing magic commands for more details.
.PP
.I Echo
is a trivial server that just returns the method, URI, any search,
the headers, and the message body sent by the client.
.PP
.I Save
writes a line to
.BI /usr/web/save/ uri .data
and returns the contents of
.BI /usr/web/save/ uri .html.
Both files must be accessible for the request to succeed.
The saved line includes the current time
and either the search string from a HEAD or GET
or the first line of the body from a POST.
It is used to record form submissions.
.PP
.I Imagemap
processes an HTML imagemap query.
It looks up a the point
.I search
in the image map file given by 
.IR uri ,
and returns a redirection to the appropriate page.
The map file defaults to NCSA format.
Any entries after a line starting with the word
.B #cern
are interpreted in CERN format.
.PP
.I Man2html
converts
.IR man (6)
format manual pages into html.
It includes some abilities to search the manuals.
