.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs
are used to manage software packages.
.PP
Packages are identified by a unique name, and should
correspond to some reference tree.
For example, the base Plan 9 installation package
is named
.I plan9
and corresponds to the root of the Plan 9 distribution file server
at Bell Labs.
Successive versions are distinguished by a date
stored as seconds since January 1, 1970.
There are three kinds of archive:
.IP
A 
.I package 
is an archive of the entire reference tree.
.I Create
writes these by default.
.IP
An 
.I update 
to a particular package contains
only files from the reference tree that differ from
those in the package, and is usually restricted to 
chosen subtrees.
For example, one might create an update
of the Plan 9 distribution package containing
only changes to 
.IR acme .
Updates can only be in reference to
packages, not other updates.
An update can only be installed if the package 
it is updating is already installed.
.I Create
writes these when given the
.B -u
flag.
.IP
An
.I update
.I package
is a hybrid of the two:
it is an update in that it contains only
files changed since some earlier package.
At the same time, once installed it functions
as a full package for the purposes of satisfying
the prerequisites of later updates.
.I Create
writes these when given the
.B -U
flag.
.PP
.I Wrap/inst
installs packages and updates,
taking into account version conflicts,
prerequisite packages, and the possibility of local modifications.
.I Wrap/info
prints information about a package or update,
and
.I wrap/wdiff
runs
.I diff
to compare files in a package or update
with installed files;
.B wdiff 
.B -l
merely lists those files modified or removed
since the package or update was created.
.PP
To decide whether a given update
contains files fresher than those currently
installed on the system, it is not enough to
compare the update's date with the
date of the most recent update to the same package:
updates may only involve parts
of a package, so updates can 
only be partially ordered.
As an example, if you have a full
Plan 9 distribution package
and two updates, one to 
.I acme 
and one to
.IR aux/vga ,
it is not correct to require one
to be installed before the other,
or to prohibit one from being installed
once the other has been.
To handle such cases,
date comparisons must 
made on a per-file basis rather
than a per-update basis.
.PP
To do this, 
.I create
includes in each package and update a list 
.BI /wrap/ name / time /md5sum
of
the contained files along with their MD5 checksums.
A file in an update will be written over an
installed file only if the installed file is
from an update older than the one currently
under consideration; otherwise a warning will
be printed.
If the currently installed file does not
have the expected checksum, that usually
indicates the presence of local modifications.
In such cases, the file is not
overwritten and a warning is printed.
This behavior can be overriden, as described below.
.PP
.I Create
writes to standard output a package
with name
.I name
and time stamp
.I time
(by default, the current time),
containing the files named by
.I proto
(see
.IR proto (2)).
In addition to the named files,
a package may contain a one-line
file describing its contents;
the file contains 
.IR desc ,
when specified.
If no
.I proto
is specified,
.B /sys/lib/sysconfig/proto/allproto
is used.
.PP
If
.I create
is given the
.B -u
flag, it compares the files contained in the
named package (which may be a file or
the name of a package installed in the
.IR root ;
see below) with those currently in
the file system, and
writes an update archive that only
contains modified files.
If no
.I proto
is given, it uses the 
.I proto
used to make the archive being updated.
If any
.I prefix es
are specified, the update is restricted
to just those changes that concern
files having names with any of the 
.I prefix es
as a prefix.
Without the
.B -u
flag, prefixes are not allowed.
If
.I create
is given the
.B -U
flag, it creates an update package.
.PP
The 
.B -l
flag to
.I create
causes it to write a list of the files it
would have included in an archive, rather
than preparing the archive itself.
.PP
.I Inst
unpacks a package or update created by 
.IR create .
It extracts from the package or update
the files with names starting with
.IR prefix es
(default all files)
and installs them in the tree
rooted at
.I root
(default
.BR / ).
.I Inst
attempts to set the modes on the 
extracted files to those in the archive.
If the
.B -o
flag is given,
.I install
will attempt to set the owner and group 
as well;
this is only possible if the
.B allow
command has been typed at the file server
(see
.IR fs (8)
or
.IR kfscmd (8)).
The 
.B -x
flag causes
.I inst
to print what actions it would do to
install the package, but not actually
perform them.
As described above,
.I inst
performs a number of checks to avoid overwriting
new files with old ones;
these checks are disabled by the
.B -F
flag.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
Create a package consisting of the entire Plan 9 distribution tree:
.IP
.EX
wrap/create -r /plan9dist -d 'Plan 9 — Third Edition' \e
	-p /sys/lib/sysconfig/proto/allproto plan9 | gzip > plan9.9gz
.EE
.PP
Create a package as well as an update package.
Note that we need to use the
.B -t
flag to make sure both have the same timestamp.
.IP
.EX
now=`{date -n}
wrap/create -r /plan9dist -d 'Plan 9 — Third Edition' -t $now \e
	-p /sys/lib/sysconfig/proto/allproto plan9 | gzip > plan9.9gz

wrap/create -Ur /plan9dist -t $now old.9gz | gzip > updatepkg.9gz
.EE
.PP
Create an update containing new VGA software:
.IP
.EX
wrap/create -ur /plan9dist `{cat /tmp/vgafiles} | gzip >vga.9gz
.EE
.PP
where 
.B /tmp/vgafiles
is a text file containing:
.IP
.EX
/386/bin/aux/vga
/lib/vgadb
/sys/src/cmd/aux/vga
/sys/src/9/pc/devvga.c
/sys/src/9/pc/vga
.EE
.PP
Note that since the strings are just
prefixes, the last line will match files such as
.B /sys/src/9/pc/vgamach64xx.c
and
.BR /sys/src/9/pc/vga.h .
.PP
Install the VGA update:
.IP
.EX
wrap/inst vga.9gz
.EE
.PP
Suppose that the update contains a new
.B /386/bin/aux/vga
and
.B /lib/vgadb
but those files
have been changed since they
were installed.
.I Install
will produce the following messages:
.IP
.EX
skipping /386/bin/aux/vga
skipping /lib/vgadb: locally updated
wrap/wdiff vga.9gz \e
	/386/bin/aux/vga \e
	/lib/vgadb
.EE
.PP
The printed command can be executed to inspect
the differences and decide which files to
overwrite with ones from the package;
to actually overwrite the files,
change
.B wdiff
to
.B update
.B -F
and send the command again.
.PP
Wrap an installed package 
.I quux 
for redistribution as a standalone package:
.IP
.EX
wrap/create -r /root -a 'Repackaged quux' quux \e
	/wrap/quux/time/proto | gzip > newquux.9gz
.EE
.PP
To view and then package just your changes:
.IP
.EX
wrap/wdiff -r /root quux.9gz 
wrap/create -u -r /root quux >quuxpatch.9gz
.EE
.SH FILES
Installed package information is maintained via
a small tree rooted at 
.IB dst /wrap \fR.
For each package and update, there is a directory
.IB name / time
that contains the following files:
.TP 
.B desc
The
.I description 
for the package, if any.
.TL \w'\fLmd5sum '
.TP
.B md5sum
A sorted list of all files in the package,
along with their MD5 checksums.
.TP
.B package
An empty file, if this is a package.
.TP
.B proto
The proto file used to create this package.
.TP
.B remove
For an update, the list of obsolete
files that should be removed.
.TP
.B update
If this is an update, contains the decimal date
of the package being updated.
.TP
.B done
The installation of the package completed successfully.
.PP
Update packages contain both
.B package
and
.B update
files.
A package is itself an
(optionally gzipped)
.IR mkfs -style
archive that contains 
.BI /wrap/ name
and
.BI /wrap/ name / time
as the
only directories under
.BR /wrap .
The entries must be the first ones in the archive
to allow for quick access in compressed archives.

.SH BUGS
Because
.I inst
sets the modes on the created files,
permission checking must be turned off
on the file server
in order to create files
in unwritable directories
or overwrite updated files
that are not normally writable.
.PP
In the absence of the
.B -l
flag (which can use the MD5 checksums alone)
.I wrap/wdiff
must uncompress the entire archive 
to pass it to
.IR archfs (4).
.PP
The terminology can be confusing.
