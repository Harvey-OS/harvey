.TH NEWUSER 8
.SH NAME
newuser \- adding a new user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rc /sys/lib/newuser
.SH DESCRIPTION
To establish a new user on Plan 9,
add the user's name to
.B /adm/users
by running the
.B newuser
command on the console of the file server
(see
.IR users (6)
and
.IR fs (8)).
Next, give the user a password using the
.B changeuser
command on the console of the authentication server
(see
.IR auth (8)).
At this point, the user can bootstrap a terminal using the new name and
password.
The terminal will only get as far as running
.BR rc ,
however, as no
.B profile
exists for the user.
.PP
The
.IR rc (1)
script
.B /sys/lib/newuser
sets up a sensible environment for a new user of Plan 9.
Once the terminal is running
.BR rc ,
type
.IP
.EX
rc /sys/lib/newuser
.EE
.PP
to build the necessary directories in
.B /usr/$user
and create a reasonable initial profile in
.BR /usr/$user/lib/profile .
The script then runs the profile which, as its last step, brings up
.IR 8½ (1).
At this point the user's environment is established and running.
(There is no need to reboot.)
It may be prudent at this point to run
.IR passwd (1)
to change the password, depending on how the initial password was chosen.
.PP
The
.B profile
built by
.B /sys/lib/newuser
looks like this:
.IP
.EX
bind -a $home/bin/rc /bin
bind -a $home/bin/$cputype /bin
font = /lib/font/bit/pelm/euro.9.font
switch($service){
case terminal
	prompt=('term% ' '	')
	fn term%{ $* }
	exec 8½
case cpu
	bind -b /mnt/term/mnt/8½ /dev
	prompt=('cpu% ' '	')
	echo -n $sysname > /dev/label
	fn cpu%{ $* }
	news
case con
	prompt=('cpu% ' '	')
	news
}
.EE
.PP
Sites may make changes to
.B /sys/lib/newuser
that reflect the properties of the local environment.
.PP
Use the
.B -c
option of
.IR mail (1)
to create a mailbox.
