.B cpurc
.PP
.B termrc
.SH DESCRIPTION
After the kernel boots, it execs
.B /boot
(see
.IR root (3)),
which in turn execs
.BR /$cputype/init .
.IR Init (8)
sets the
.B $service
environment variable to
.B cpu
or
.BR terminal ,
and then invokes the appropriate
.B rc
script to bring the system up.
.PP
Based on the values of
.B $sysname
and
.B $terminal
these scripts start appropriate network processes and
administrative daemons and enable swapping.
.B Cpurc
sets
.B /env/boottime
to the time
.I cpurc
was executed and
.B /env/NPROC
to a value suitable for parallel compilation in
.IR mk (1).
