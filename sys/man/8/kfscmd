.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Kfs
is a local user-level file server for a Plan 9 terminal with a disk.
.I Kfscmd
transmits commands to the
.I kfs
server (see
.IR kfs (4)).
The
.B -n
option changes the name of the kfs service to
.BI kfs. name
(by default, full name is just
.BR kfs ).
.PP
.I Ksync
executes the
.B sync
command for all active
.I kfs
servers.
.PP
The known commands are described below.
Note that some commands are multiple words and
should be quoted to appear as a single argument to
.IR rc (1).
.TP \w'\fLallowoff\ \fIn'u
.B allow
Turn permission checking off (to simplify administration).
.TP
.B allowoff
.TP
.B disallow
Turn permission checking on.
.TP
.B noauth
Disable authentication of users.
.TP
.B halt
Write all changed blocks and stop the file system.
.TP
.B start
The opposite of halt; restart the file system.
.TP
.B help
Print the list of commands.
.TP
.BI "rename " "file name"
Change the name of
.I file
to
.IR name .
.I Name
may be a single path element or a full path; if it is a full path,
every element along the path must exist except the last.
.TP
.BI "newuser " user
Add
.I user
to
.B /adm/users
and make the standard directories needed for booting.
.TP
.BI "remove " file
Remove
.I file
and place its blocks on the free list.
.TP
.BI "clri " file
Remove 
.I file
but do not place the blocks on the free list.
This command can be used to remove files that have duplicated blocks.
The non-duplicate blocks can be retrieved by checking the file system
with option
.B f
(see below).
.TP
.BI create \ file\ owner\ group\ mode\  [adl]
Create the file.  Owner and group are users in
.B /adm/users
and mode is an octal number.
If present,
.L a
creates an append only file,
.L d
creates a directory, and
.L l
creates a file that is exclusive-use.
.TP
.B sync
Write to disk all of the dirty blocks in the memory cache.
.TP
.B atime
Toggle whether atimes are updated as files and directories
are accessed.  By default, atimes are updated.  On laptops it can be
useful to turn off atime updates to reduce disk accesses.
.TP
.B stats
Report statistics about the performance of the file system.
.TP
.B user
Re-initialize authentication information by reading
.BR /adm/users .
.TP
.B nowritegroup
Each time
.I kfs
rereads
.BR /adm/users ,
it looks for a group named
.BR write .
If such a group exists, then the entire file system
will appear read-only to users not in the group.
If a write group exists but no one is in it,
it will be impossible to edit
.B /adm/users
to correct the problem.
To resolve this, the
.B nowritegroup
command turns off write group checking until the next
time
.B /adm/users
is reread.
.TP
.BI cfs " filsys
Change the `console' to the named file system (default is the main system).
.TP
.B chat
Toggle tracing of 9P messages.
.TP
.B check [cdfpPqrtw]
Check the file system and print summary information.
The options are
.PD 0
.RS
.TP
.B c
fix bad tags and clear the contents of the block.
.TP
.B d
delete redundant references to a block, fix bad UTF filenames.
.TP
.B f
rebuild the list of free blocks.
.TP
.B p
print the names of directories as they are checked.
.TP
.B P
print the names of all files as they are checked.
.TP
.B q
quiet mode: report errors, but suppress summary information
.TP
.B r
read all of the data blocks and check the tags.
.TP
.B t
fix bad tags.
.TP
.B w
write all of the blocks that are touched.
.RE
.PD
.TP
.BI listen " [address]
Start a listener to serve the network at 
.IR address ,
default
.BR il!*!17008 .
This feature is intended to facilitate small networks of a couple
machines in the situation when convenience is more
important than performance.
This command is only useful on machines with
(possibly simulated) NVRAM, which needs to be readable
to the
.I kfs
processes;
see
.I readnvram
in
.IR authsrv (2).
The production file server
(see
.IR fs (4))
is strongly encouraged for anything more than casual use.
.TP
.B noneattach
When listening to the network, the default behavior is that the user
.B none
may only attach over connections that have already
authenticated as someone else.
This prevents just anyone from being
able to dial your server and attach as
.BR none .
The
.B noneattach
command toggles whether 
.B none
can attach without such a chaperone.
