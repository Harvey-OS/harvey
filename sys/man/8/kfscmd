.TP
.BI listen " [address]
Start a listener to serve the network at 
.IR address ,
default
.BR il!*!17008 .
This feature is intended to facilitate small networks of a couple
machines in the situation when convenience is more
important than performance.
This command is only useful on a CPU server, because
.B #c/key
needs to be readable.
The production file server
(see
.IR fs (4))
is strongly encouraged for anything more than casual use.
.TP
.B noneattach
When listening to the network, the default behavior is that the user
.B none
may only attach over connections that have already
authenticated as someone else.
This prevents just anyone from being
able to dial your server and attach as
.BR none .
The
.B noneattach
command toggles whether 
.B none
can attach without such a chaperone.
