command for all active
.I kfs
servers.

Add
.I user
to
.B /adm/users
and make the standard directories needed for booting.

.BI "remove " file
Remove
.I file
and place its blocks on the free list.
.TP
.BI "clri " file
Remove 
.I file
but do not place the blocks on the free list.
This command can be used to remove files that have duplicated blocks.
The non-duplicate blocks can be retrieved by checking the file system
with option
.B f
(see below).
.TP
.BI create \ file\ owner\ group\ mode\  [adl]
Create the file.  Owner and group are users in
.B /adm/users
and mode is an octal number.
If present,
.L a
creates an append only file,
.L d
creates a directory, and
.L l
creates a file that is exclusive-use.
.TP
.B sync
Write to disk all of the dirty blocks in the memory cache.
.TP
.B atime
Toggle whether atimes are updated as files and directories
are accessed.  By default, atimes are updated.  On laptops it can be
useful to turn off atime updates to reduce disk accesses.

.RE
.PD
.TP
.BI listen " [address]
Start a listener to serve the network at 
.IR address ,
default
.BR il!*!17008 .
This feature is intended to facilitate small networks of a couple
machines in the situation when convenience is more
important than performance.
This command is only useful on machines with
(possibly simulated) NVRAM, which needs to be readable
to the
.I kfs
processes;
see
.I readnvram
in
.IR authsrv (2).
The production file server
(see
.IR fs (4))
is strongly encouraged for anything more than casual use.
.TP
.B noneattach
When listening to the network, the default behavior is that the user
.B none
may only attach over connections that have already
authenticated as someone else.
This prevents just anyone from being
able to dial your server and attach as
.BR none .
The
.B noneattach
command toggles whether 
.B none
can attach without such a chaperone.
