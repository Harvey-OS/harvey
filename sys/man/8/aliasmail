.TH ALIASMAIL 8
.SH NAME
aliasmail \-  expand system wide mail aliases
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upas/aliasmail
.I arg ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Aliasmail 
expands mail aliases, its arguments, according to alias files.
.I Aliasmail
is normally invoked by a rule in the
upas rewrite file,
.IR rewrite (6).
.PP
If a line of an alias file begins with
.BR #include ,
the line is replaced by the contents of the file whose name follows.
Other lines, beginning with
.B #
are ignored as comment.
.PP
Otherwise, lines begin with a name.
The rest of a name line gives the expansion.
The expansion may contain multiple addresses and may be continued
to another line by appending a backslash.
Items are separated by white space.
.PP
The alias files are searched in the order they are
listed, one per line, in
.BR /mail/lib/namefiles .
If the name is not found, the expansion is taken to be
.BI local! name\f1.
Under the
.B -f
option,
alias files listed in
.B /mail/lib/fromfiles
are consulted instead,
and the domain part only of the expansion is printed.
