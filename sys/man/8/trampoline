.TH TRAMPOLINE 8
.SH NAME
trampoline \- forward incoming calls to another address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aux/trampoline
[
.B -m9
]
.I addr
.RI [ netdir ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trampoline
can be used in a service file (see
.IR listen (8))
to link an incoming call to
another address that provides the service, typically on another machine.
.PP
.I Trampoline
dials
.I addr
and copies data between that connection
and its own standard input and output.
Use the
.B -9
option if the connection carries only unencrypted 9P messages, to allow
.I trampoline
to size its buffer automatically.
.PP
Forwarding can be restricted to a particular calling machine,
using the
.B -m
option.
.I Netdir
must be the incoming call directory.
.I Trampoline
finds the caller's MAC address
.I m
and checks that
.IR ndb (6)
contains an entry with
.BI ether= m
and the attribute
.BR trampok .
If no such entry is found, the call is rejected.
.SH FILES
.TF /sys/log/trampoline
.TP
.B /sys/log/trampoline
logs rejected calls
