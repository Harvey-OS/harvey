.TH BOOTING 8
.SH NAME
booting \- bootstrapping procedures
.SH SYNOPSIS
none
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page collects the incantations required to bootstrap Plan 9 machines.
Some of the information here is specific to the installation at Bell Labs;
some is generic.
.PP
If a CPU server is up, BOOTP/DHCP and TFTP will run from there;
if not, the necessary files and services must be available on a separate machine,
such as a Unix system, to use these protocols for bootstrapping.
.PP
Be sure to read
.IR boot (8)
to understand what happens after the kernel is loaded.
.SS Terminals
To bootstrap a diskless terminal or a CPU server, a file server must be running.
PCs can boot from a floppy disk or any FAT16 partition.
On all the terminals, typing two control-T's followed by a lower-case
.B r
reboots the machine;
other methods of rebooting are mentioned for some machines.
.SS PCs
To boot a PC, it is necessary to get
.B /386/9boot
or
.B /386/9load
loaded into memory.
There are many ways to do this.  A Plan 9 boot floppy prepared by
.B format
(see
.IR prep (8))
will load
.B 9load
when the PC is reset or powered on.
Other methods are described in 
.IR 9boot (8).
.I 9boot
or
.I 9load
then locates and loads a Plan 9 kernel, using configuration information
from the matching file in
.B /cfg/pxe
.RI ( 9boot )
or the file
.B plan9.ini
stored in the
.B 9fat
configuration partition or on a DOS file system
.RI ( 9load ).
See 
.IR 9boot (8)
for details.
.PP
Once the kernel is booted, it behaves like the others.
See
.IR boot (8)
for details.
.SS CPU Servers
The Plan 9 CPU servers are multi-user, so they do not request a user name
when booting.
On the CPU servers, typing a control-P on the console reboots the machine.
.SS PC CPU Server
Proceed as for the PC terminal, but load
.B /386/9pccpu
or
.BR /386/9pccpudisk .
.SS SGI Challenge multiprocessor CPU Server
The Challenge ROM monitor can boot from the Ethernet.
To boot from the Ethernet, type
.IP
.EX
.B bootp()/mips/9ch
.EE
.PP
or use the ROM command
.B setenv
to set the variable
.B bootfile
to that same string and type
.BR boot .
To load a different file, tell
.B bootp
which file to load,
and to force the download to come from a particular system,
.BR bootp()system:file .
Any arguments after
.B bootp()file
are passed to
.BR /boot .
If you are running a Plan 9
.SM BOOTP
server (see
.IR dhcpd (8)),
the file name can be omitted and the
file specified by the
.B bootf
parameter for the machine in
.B /lib/ndb
will be downloaded by default.
.PP
Once the kernel is loaded,
it prompts for the Ethernet
protocol to use to reach the root file server; request the default.
.
.SS ARM Systems
All ARM systems are started by
.I U-boot
using similar commands.
The kernels
(and thus
.I ndb
.L bootf
parameters)
are
.TF /arm/9beagl
.TP
.L /arm/9gd
for the Marvell PXA168-based Guruplug Display
.TP
.L /arm/9plug
for other Marvell Kirkwoods (Sheevaplug, Guruplug, Dreamplug, Openrd, etc.)
.TP
.L /arm/9beagle
for TI OMAP3 boards (IGEPv2 from ISEE, Gumstix Overo)
.TP
.L /arm/9ts
for Trimslice systems, which contain the Nvidia Tegra 2
.TP
.L /arm/9pi
.TP
.L /arm/9picpu
for Raspberry Pis
.PD
.LP
In the following,
replace
.I MAC
with your board's MAC address without colons,
in lower case
(the format of the
.L ether
.I ndb
attribute).
If loading from a non-Plan-9
TFTP server,
replace
.L %C
with
.BI /cfg/pxe/ MAC.
.PP
First, establish a
.I /cfg/pxe
(\c
.IR plan9.ini )
file for the new CPU server.
For Kirkwood plugs,
.IP
.EX
cd /cfg/pxe; cp example-kw \fIMAC
.EE
.PP
and edit
.L /cfg/pxe/\fIMAC
to taste.
For PXA plugs, replace
.L kw
with
.LR pxa ;
for OMAP boards, replace
.L kw
with
.LR omap
and
be sure to edit the line for
.L ether0
to set
.IP
.EX
ea=\fIMAC
.EE
.PP
Second,
configure
.I U-boot
to load the appropriate kernel and
.I /cfg/pxe
file at suitable addresses and start the kernel.
For Sheevaplugs and Openrd boards,
type this at U-boot once:
.IP
.EX
setenv bootdelay 2
# \fItype the next two lines as one\fP
setenv bootcmd 'bootp; bootp; tftp 0x1000 %C; bootp; tftp 0x800000;
	go 0x800000'
saveenv
.EE
.PP
For Guruplugs Displays,
do the same but type this after
.L "setenv bootcmd"
instead:
.IP
.EX
\&'dhcp; tftpboot; tftpboot 0x1000 %C; bootz 0x500000'
.EE
.PP
For Kirkwood Guruplugs,
type this after
.LR "setenv bootcmd" :
.IP
.EX
\&'dhcp 0x800000; tftp 0x1000 %C; go 0x800000'
.EE
.PP
For IGEPv2 boards,
type this after
.LR "setenv bootcmd" :
.IP
.EX
\&'tftp 0x80300000 %C; dhcp 0x80310000; go 0x80310000'
.EE
.PP
For Gumstix Overo boards,
type this after
.LR "setenv bootcmd" :
.IP
.EX
\&'bootp 0x80310000; bootp 0x80300000 %C; go 0x80310000'
.EE
.PP
For Trimslice systems,
type this after
.LR "setenv bootcmd" :
.IP
.EX
\&'dhcp; dhcp; tftpboot 0x410000; tftpboot 0x400000 %C; go 0x410000'
.EE
.PP
For Raspberry Pis,
.I gunzip
the
.B pi.uboot.sd.img.gz
named below onto an SD card and insert that into your Pi.
.PP
Thereafter, the boards will automatically boot via BOOTP and TFTP
when reset.
.
.SH FILES
.B /n/sources/extra/pi.uboot.sd.img.gz
is a compressed bootable SD card image for Raspberry Pi, uses PXE booting.
