.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs support booting over the Internet.
They should all be run on the same server to
allow other systems to be booted.
.I Rarpd
and
.I tftpd
are used to boot Suns.
.I Bootp
and
.I tftpd
are used to boot everything else.
.PP
.I Bootp
passes to Plan 9 systems their IP address, IP mask, default boot file, default
file server, default authentication server, and default gateway.
These come from the network database file attributes
.IR ip ", " ipmask ", " bootf ", "
.IR fs ", " auth ", "
and
.I ipgw
attributes respectively
(see
.IR ndb (6)
and
.IR ndb (8)).
The attributes come from the entry for the system, its subnet, and its network
with the system entry having precedence, subnet next, and network last.
The
.B -d
option causes debugging to be printed to standard out.
.PP
.I Rarpd

Ethernet addresses into Internet addresses.

.TP
.B d

.TP
.B e

.RI /net/ etherdev
.PP
.I Tftpd

It runs as user
.I none
and can only access files with world read permission.
The options are:
.TP
.B d
print debugging to standard output
.TP
.B h
change directory to
.IR homedir .
The default is

directory with the exception of files of the form
.B xxxxxxxx.SUN4C.
These are Sparc kernel boot files where
.B xxxxxxxx
is the hex IP address of the machine requesting the kernel.
.I Tftpd
looks up the file in the network database using
and responds with the bootfile specified for that particular
machine.
If no booftile is specified, the transfer fails.
.I Tftpd
supports only octet mode.
