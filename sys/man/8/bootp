.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs support booting over the Internet.
They should all be run on the same server to
allow other systems to be booted.
.I Bootp
and
.I tftpd
are used to boot everything;
.I rarpd
is an extra piece just for Suns.
.PP
.I Bootp
passes to Plan 9 systems their IP address, IP mask, default boot file, default
file server, default authentication server, and default gateway.
These come from the network database file attributes
.BR ip ,
.BR ipmask ,
.BR bootf ,
.BR fs ,
.BR auth ,
and
.B ipgw
attributes respectively
(see
.IR ndb (6)
and
.IR ndb (8)).
The attributes come from the entry for the system, its subnet, and its network
with the system entry having precedence, subnet next, and network last.
.I Bootp
will answer requests only if it has been specifically targeted or if it
has read access to
the boot file for the requester.
The
.B -d
option causes debugging to be printed to standard output.
.PP
.I Rarpd
performs the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol, translating
Ethernet addresses into IP addresses.
The options are:
.TP
.B d
print debugging to standard output
.TP
.B e
use the Ethernet mounted at
.BI /net/ etherdev
.PP
.I Tftpd
transfers files to systems that are booting.
It runs as user
.B none
and can only access files with global read permission.
The options are:
.TP
.B d
print debugging to standard output
.TP
.B h
change directory to
.IR homedir .
The default is
.BR /lib/tftpd .
All requests for files with non-rooted file names are served starting at this
directory with the exception of files of the form
.BR xxxxxxxx.SUNyy .
These are Sparc kernel boot files where
.B xxxxxxxx
is the hex IP address of the machine requesting the kernel and
.B yy
is an architecture identifier.
.I Tftpd
looks up the file in the network database using
.I ipinfo
(see
.IR ndb (2))
and responds with the boot file specified for that particular
machine.
If no boot file is specified, the transfer fails.
.I Tftpd
supports only octet mode.
.TP
.B r
restricts access to only files rooted in the
.IR homedir .
