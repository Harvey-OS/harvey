.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mk9660
reads the file system archive
.I ifile
as prepared by
.IR mkfs (8)
and produces a file system on
.I ofile
.RB ( cd-rom
by default)
in ISO-9660 format.
.PP
The options to
.I mk9660
are:
.TP
.B c
Convert all file names in the file system
so that they conform to 9660 standards.
(Roughly this is eight or fewer single case
alphanumerics followed by an optional
period and three or fewer single case alphanumerics.)
File names that conform are converted from
lower case letters in the input
filesystem to upper case
in the output file system.
Files that do not conform 
are renamed to
.BI F number
and directories are renamed
.BI D number.
A file named
.B _CONFORM.MAP
is created in the root of the
output file system with old-name
new-name pairs of all converted files.
.TP
.B e
Add a
.I system-use
field to every directory record that
contains the name, uid, gid and mode
of the file.
With or without this extension,
directory records conform to the 9660
standard and should be able to be read
on other systems.
.TP
.B a
Places the named file to
the abstract field of the primary volume descriptor.
The file must be in the root directory.
.TP
.B b
Places the named file in
the bibliographic field of the primary volume descriptor.
The file must be in the root directory.
.TP
.B n
Places the named file in
the copyright field of the primary volume descriptor.
The file must be in the root directory.
.PP
All dates in the output file system are set to
the date the command was executed.
The volume identifier field of the primary
volume descriptor is set to the last
component of
.IR ifile .
The system identifier field of the primary
volume descriptor is set to
.BR "PLAN 9" ,
and should be keyed to the interpretation
of the system-use fields of the directory
records.
.PP
.I Pump
reads
.I ifile
.RB ( cd-rom
by default)
and issues the SCSI commands
to write a Phillips CDD 521
Compact Disk Recorder.
The file is uninterpreted,
but it can be a 9660 file system
as produced by
.IR mk9660 (8).
The CD writer requires a sustained data rate of
305,600 bytes/sec.
To get this rate on an Ethernet from a file server,
.I pump
creates several processes that read ahead into shared
buffers.
Even so,
the file system should have fast disks or
multiple disks with interleaved overlapping seeks.
The options to
.I pump
are:
.TP
.B t
specifies the SCSI target
(default 1)
for the CD writer.
.TP
.B m
specifies the total buffer space
(default 10)
in megabytes.
.TP
.B n
specifies the number
(default 3)
of read-ahead processes.
.SH BUGS
The
.I pump
command does not correctly set up the SCSI bus.
Use the
.IR scuzz (8)
command to
.I open
the desired SCSI target.
