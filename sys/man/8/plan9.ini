.TH PLAN9.INI 8
.SH NAME
plan9.ini \- configuration file for PCs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I none
.SH DESCRIPTION
When booting Plan 9 on a PC, the DOS program
.IR 9load (8)
first reads a DOS file
containing configuration information from the boot disk.
This file,
.BR plan9.ini ,
looks like a shell script containing lines of the form
.IP
.EX
name=\f2value\fP
.EE
.LP
each of which defines a kernel or device parameter.
.PP
Blank lines and
Carriage Returns
.IB ( \er )
are ignored.
.B #
comments are ignored, but are only recognised if
.L #
appears at the start of a line.
.PP
For devices, the generic format of
.I value
is
.IP
.EX
type=TYPE [port=N] [irq=N] [mem=N] [size=N] [dma=N] [ea=N]
.EE
.LP
specifying the controller type,
the base I/O port of the interface, its interrupt
level, the physical starting address of any mapped memory,
the length in bytes of that memory, the DMA channel,
and for Ethernets an override of the physical network address.
Not all elements are relevant to all devices; the relevant values
and their defaults are defined below in the description of each device.
.PP
The file is used by
.B 9load
and the kernel to configure the hardware available.
The information it contains is also passed to the boot
process, and subsequently other programs,
as environment variables
(see
.IR boot (8)).
However, values whose names begin with an asterisk
.B *
are used by the kernel and are not converted into environment variables.
.PP
The following sections describe how variables are used.
.SS ETHERNET
.SS \fLetherX=value\fP
This defines an Ethernet interface.
.IR X ,
a unique monotonically increasing number beginning at 0,
identifies an Ethernet card to be probed at system boot.
Probing stops when a card is found or there is no line for
.BR etherX+1 .
After probing as directed by the
.BI ether X
lines, any remaining Ethernet cards that can be automatically
detected are added.
Almost all cards can be automatically detected.
For debugging purposes, automatic probing can
be disabled by specifying the line
.BR *noetherprobe= .
This automatic probing is only done by the kernel, not by
.IR 9load (8).
Thus, if you want to load a kernel over the Ethernet, you need
to specify an
.B ether0
line so that
.I 9load
can find the Ethernet card, even if the kernel would
have automatically detected it.
.PP
Some cards are software configurable and do not require all options.
Unspecified options default to the factory defaults.

can be used to turn off (0) or on (1) a dummy remote read in the driver
in such cases,
depending on how NE2000 compatible they are.
.TP
.B ne2000
Not software configurable iff ISA;
PCI clones or supersets are software configurable;
includes the Realtek 8029 clone used by Parallels.
16-bit card.
Defaults are
.EX
	port=0x300 irq=2 mem=0x04000 size=0x4000

.TP
.B sink
A
.B /dev/null
for Ethernet packets \(em the interface discards sent
packets and never receives any.
This is used to provide a test bed for
some experimental Ethernet bridging software.
.TP
.B wavelan
Lucent Wavelan (Orinoco) IEEE 802.11b
and compatible PCMCIA cards.
Compatible cards include the Dell TrueMobile 1150
and the Linksys Instant Wireless Network PC Card.
Port and IRQ defaults are 0x180 and 3 respectively.
.IP
These cards take a number of unique options to aid in
identifying the card correctly on the 802.11b network.
The network may be
.I "ad hoc"
or
.I managed
(i.e. use an access point):
.EX
	mode=[adhoc, managed]
.EE
and defaults to
.IR managed .
The 802.11b network to attach to
.RI ( managed
mode)
or identify as
.RI ( "ad hoc"
mode),
is specified by
.EX
	essid=string
.EE
and defaults to a null string.
The card station name is given by
.EX
	station=string
.EE
and defaults to
.IR "Plan 9 STA" .
The channel to use is given by
.EX
	channel=number
.EE
where
.I number
lies in the range 1 to 16 inclusive;
the channel is normally negotiated automatically.
.IP
If the card is capable of encryption,
the following options may be used:
.EX
	crypt=[off, on]
.EE
and defaults to
.IR on .
.EX
	key\fIN\fP=string
.EE
sets the encryption key
.I N
(where
.I N
is in the range 1 to 4 inclusive) to
.IR string ;
this will also set the transmit key to
.I N
(see below).
There are two formats for
.I string
which depend on the length of the string.
If it is exactly 5 or 13 characters long it is assumed
to be an alphanumeric key; if it is exactly 10 or 26 characters
long the key is assumed to be in hex format (without a leading
.IR 0x ).
The lengths are checked,
as is the format of a hex key.
.EX
	txkey=number
.EE
sets the transmit key to use to be
.I number
in the range 1 to 4 inclusive.
If it is desired to exclude or include unencrypted packets
.EX
	clear=[off, on]
.EE
configures reception and defaults to inclusion.
.IP
The defaults are intended to match the common case of
a managed network with encryption and a typical entry would
only require, for example
.EX
	essid=left-armpit key1=afish key2=calledraawaru
.EE
if the port and IRQ defaults are used.
These options may be set after boot by writing to the device's
.I ctl
file using a space as the separator between option and value, e.g.
.EX
	echo 'key2 1d8f65c9a52d83c8e4b43f94af' >/net/ether0/0/ctl
.EE
.IP
Card-specific power management may be enabled/disabled by
.EX
	pm=[on, off]
.EE
.TP
.B wavelanpci
PCI Ethernet adapters that use the same Wavelan
programming interface.
Currently the only tested cards are those based on the
Intersil Prism 2.5 chipset.
.
.SS DISKS, TAPES
(S)ATA controllers are autodetected.
.SS \fLusbX=type=uhci\fP
.SS \fLusbX=type=ohci\fP
This specifies the settings for a USB UHCI or OHCI controller.
Like the Ethernet controllers, USB controllers are autodetected
after scanning for the ones listed in
.IR plan9.ini .
Thus, most systems will not need a
.B usbX
line.
Also like the Ethernet controllers, USB autoprobing can be
disabled by specifying the line
.BR *nousbprobe= .
.SS \fLscsiX=value\fP
This defines a SCSI interface which cannot be automatically detected
by the kernel.
.PP
Known
.IR TYPE s 
are
.TP
.B aha1542
Adaptec 154x series of controllers (and clones).
Almost completely configurable, only the
.EX
	port=0x300
.EE
option need be given.
.PP
NCR/Symbios/LSI-Logic 53c8xx-based adapters
and Mylex MultiMaster (Buslogic BT-*) adapters are
automatically detected and need no entries.
.PP
By default, the NCR 53c8xx driver searches for up to 32 controllers.
This can be changed by setting the variable
.BR *maxsd53c8xx .
.PP
By default the Mylex driver resets SCSI cards by using
both the hard reset and SCSI bus reset flags in the driver interface.
If a variable
.BR *noscsireset
is defined, the SCSI bus reset flag is omitted.
.SS \fLaoeif=\fP\fIlist\fP
This specifies a space-separated
.I list
of Ethernet interfaces to be bound at boot to the ATA-over-Ethernet driver,
.IR aoe (3).
For example,
.LR "aoeif=ether0 ether1" .
Only interfaces on this list will initially be accessible via AoE.
.SS \fLaoedev=e!#æ/aoe/\fIshelf\fL.\fIslot\fR
This specifies an ATA-over-Ethernet device accessible via the interfaces
named in
.IR aoeif
on AoE
.I shelf
and
.I slot
to use as a root device for bootstrapping.
.SS AUDIO
.SS \fLaudioX=value\fP
This defines a sound interface.
.PP
Known types are
.TF ess1688
.PD
.TP
.B sb16
Sound Blaster 16.
.TP
.B ess1688
A Sound Blaster clone.
.PP
The DMA channel may be any of 5, 6, or 7.
The defaults are
.IP
.EX
port=0x220 irq=7 dma=5
.EE
.SS Uarts
Plan 9 automatically configures COM1 and COM2, if found,
as
.B eia0
(port 0x3F8, IRQ4)
and
.B eia1
(port 0x2F8, IRQ3)
respectively.
These devices can be disabled by adding a line:
.IP
.EX
eia\fIX\fP=disabled
.EE
.LP
This is typically done in order to reuse the IRQ for
another device.
.PP
Plan 9 used to support various serial concentrators,
including the TTC 8 serial line card and various models
in the Star Gate Avanstar series of intelligent serial boards.
These are no longer supported; the much simpler
Perle PCI-Fast4, PCI-Fast8, and PCI-Fast16 controllers
have taken their places.
These latter cards are automatically detected
and need no configuration lines.
.PP
The line
.B serial=type=com
can be used to specify settings for a PCMCIA modem.
.SS \fLmouseport=value\fP
This specifies where the mouse is attached.
.I Value
can be
.TP
.B ps2
the PS2 mouse/keyboard port.  The BIOS setup procedure
should be used to configure the machine appropriately.
.TP
.B ps2intellimouse
an Intellimouse on the PS2 port.
.TP
.B 0
for COM1
.TP
.B 1
for COM2
.SS \fLmodemport=value\fP
Picks the UART line to call out on.
This is used when connecting to a file server over
an async line.
.I Value
is the number of the port.
.SS \fLconsole=value params\fP
This is used to specify the console device.
The default
value is
.BR cga ;
a number
.B 0
or
.B 1
specifies
.I COM1
or
.I COM2
respectively.
A serial console is initially configured with the
.IR uart (3)
configuration string
.B b9600
.B l8
.B pn
.BR s1 ,
specifying 9600 baud,
8 bit bytes, no parity, and one stop bit.
If
.I params
is given, it will be used to further
configure the uart.
Notice that there is no
.B =
sign in the
.I params
syntax.
For example,
.IP
.EX
console=0 b19200 po
.EE
.LP
would use COM1 at 19,200 baud
with odd parity.
.SS "PC CARD"
.SS \fLpccard0=disabled\fP
Disable probing for and automatic configuration of PC card controllers.
.SS \fLpcmciaX=type=XXX irq=value\fP
If the default IRQ for the
PCMCIA
is correct, this entry can be omitted.  The value of
.B type
is ignored.
.SS \fLpcmcia0=disabled\fP
Disable probing for and automatic configuration of PCMCIA controllers.
.SS BOOTING
.SS \fLbootfile=value\fP
This is used to direct the actions of
.IR 9load (8)
by naming the device and file from which to load the kernel.
.SS \fLrootdir=dir\fP
.SS \fLrootspec=spec\fP
These are used by
.IR 9load (8)
to identify the directory
.I dir
to make the root directory for the kernel, and the
file system specifier
.I spec
(see
.B mount
in
.IR bind (2))
on which it can be found.
These are usually used to test variant file systems for distributions, etc.
.SS \fLbootargs=value\fP
The value of this variable is passed to
.IR boot (8)
by the kernel as the name of the root file system.
It is typically used to specify additional arguments to
pass to
.IR kfs (4)
or
.IR ipconfig (8).
For example, if the system is to run from a local
.IR kfs (4)
partition, the definition might read
.BR bootargs=local!#S/sdC0/fs .
See
.IR boot (8)
for more.
.SS \fLnobootprompt=value\fP
Suppress the
.L "root from"
prompt and use
.I value
as the answer instead.
.SS \fLuser=value\fP
Suppress the
.L "user"
prompt and use
.I value
as the answer instead.
.SS \fLdebugfactotum=\fP
Causes
.IR boot (8)
to start
.I factotum
with the
.B -p
option, so that it can be debugged.
.SS \fLfactotumopts=options\fP
Causes
.IR boot (8)
to start
.I factotum
with the given
.IR options ,
which must be a single word (i.e., contain no whitespace).
.SS \fLventi=value\fP
When booting from a local fossil server backed by a local
or remote venti server,
this variable specifies how to establish the connection to the
venti server.
See
.IR boot (8)
for more.
.SS \fLcfs=value\fP
This gives the name of the file holding the disk partition
for the cache file system,
.IR cfs (4).
Extending the
.B bootargs
example, one would write
.BR cfs=#S/sdC0/cache .
.SS \fLbootdisk=value\fP
This deprecated variable was used to specify the disk used by
the cache file system and other disk-resident services.
It is superseded by
.B bootargs
and
.BR cfs .
.SS \fLpartition=value\fP
This defines the partition table
.IR 9load (8)
will examine to find disk partitioning information.
By default, a partition table in a Plan 9 partition
is consulted; if no such table is found, an old-Plan 9
partition table on the next-to-last or last sector
of the disk is consulted.
A value of
.B new
consults only the first table,
.B old
only the second.
.SS \fLreadparts=\fP
Causes
.I boot
to look for MBR and Plan 9 partition tables on all
.IR sd (3)
disks, even before
.I factotum
is started, so NVRAM, for example, may be found.
On PCs,
.I 9load
normally does this,
so this variable is intended for other architectures.
.SS \fLfs=a.b.c.d\fP
.SS \fLauth=a.b.c.d\fP
These specify the IP address of the file and authentication server
to use when mounting a network-provided root file system.
They are used only if the addresses cannot be determined via DHCP.
.SS PROCESSOR
.SS \fL*norealmode=\fP
The PC kernel switches the processor to 16-bit real mode
to run BIOS interrupts, for example to find the memory map or to enable VESA.
This variable disables such switches.
.SS \fL*noe820scan=\fP
When available, the PC kernel uses the BIOS E820 memory map
to size memory.  This variable disables the scan.
.SS \fL*maxmem=value\fP
This defines the maximum physical address that the system will scan when sizing memory.
By default the PC operating system will scan up to 3.75 gigabytes
(0xF0000000, the base of kernel virtual address space), but setting
.B *maxmem
will limit the scan.
.B *maxmem
must be less than 3.75 gigabytes.
This variable is not consulted if using the E820 memory map.
.SS \fL*kernelpercent=value\fP
This defines what percentage of available memory is reserved for the kernel allocation pool.
The remainder is left for user processes.  The default
.I value
is
.B 30
on CPU servers,
.B 60
on terminals with less than 16MB of memory,
and
.B 40
on terminals with memories of 16MB or more.
Terminals use more kernel memory because
.IR draw (3)
maintains its graphic images in kernel memory.
This deprecated option is rarely necessary in newer kernels.
.SS \fL*nomce=value\fP
If machine check exceptions are supported by the processor,
then they are enabled by default.
Setting this variable to
.B 1
causes them to be disabled even when available.
.SS \fL*nomp=\fP
A multiprocessor machine will enable all processors by default.
Setting
.B *nomp
restricts the kernel to starting only one processor and using the
traditional interrupt controller.
.SS \fL*ncpu=value\fP
Setting
.B *ncpu
restricts the kernel to starting at most
.I value
processors.
.SS \fL*pcimaxbno=value\fP
This puts a limit on the maximum bus number probed
on a PCI bus (default 7).
For example, a
.I value
of 1 should suffice on a 'standard' motherboard with an AGP slot.
This, and
.B *pcimaxdno
below are rarely used and only on troublesome or suspect hardware.
.SS \fL*pcimaxdno=value\fP
This puts a limit on the maximum device number probed
on a PCI bus (default 31).
.SS \fL*nopcirouting=\fP
Disable pci routing during boot.  May solve interrupt routing
problems on certain machines.
.SS \fL*nodumpstack=\fP
Disable printing a stack dump on panic.
Useful if there is only a limited cga screen available,
otherwise the textual information about the panic may scroll off.
.\" .SS \fL*nobios=\fP
.\" what does this do?  something with pci
.SS \fLioexclude=value\fP
Specifies a list of ranges of I/O ports to exclude from use by drivers.
Ranges are inclusive on both ends and separated by commas.
For example:
.EX
    ioexclude=0x330-0x337,0x430-0x43F
.EE
.SS \fLumbexclude=value\fP
Specifies a list of ranges of UMB to exclude from use by drivers.
Ranges are inclusive on both ends and separated by commas.
For example:
.EX
    umbexclude=0xD1800-0xD3FFF
.EE
.SS \fLapm0=\fP
This enables the ``advanced power management'' interface
as described in
.IR apm (3)
and
.IR apm (8).
The main feature of the interface is the ability to watch
battery life (see
.IR stats (8)).
It is not on by default because it causes problems on some laptops.
.SS VIDEO
.SS \fLmonitor=value\fP
.SS \fLvgasize=value\fP
These are used not by the kernel but by
.I termrc
(see
.IR cpurc (8))
when starting
.IR vga (8).
.SS \fL*dpms=value\fP
This is used to specify the screen blanking behavior of the MGA4xx
video driver.
Values are
.BR standby ,
.BR suspend ,
and
.BR off .
The first two specify differing levels of power saving;
the third turns the monitor off completely.
.SS NVRAM
.SS \fLnvram=file\fP
.SS \fLnvrlen=length\fP
.SS \fLnvroff=offset\fP
This is used to specify an nvram device and optionally the length of the ram
and read/write offset to use.
These values are consulted by
.I readnvram
(see
.IR authsrv (2)).
The most common use of the nvram is to hold a
.IR secstore (1)
password for use by
.IR factotum (4).
.SS \fLnvr=value\fP
This is used by the WORM file server kernel to locate a file holding information
to configure the file system.
The file cannot live on a SCSI disk.
The default is
.B fd!0!plan9.nvr
(sic),
unless
.B bootfile
is set, in which case it is
.B plan9.nvr
on the same disk as
.BR bootfile .
The syntax is either
.BI fd! unit ! name
or
.BI hd! unit ! name
where
.I unit
is the numeric unit id.
This variant syntax is a vestige of the file server kernel's origins.
.SS Multiple Configurations
.PP
A
.B plan9.ini
file may contain multiple configurations,
each within a block beginning with a line
.EX
	[tag]
.EE
A special block with the tag
.B menu
gives a list of blocks from which the user may
interactively select the contents of
.BR plan9.ini .
There may also be multiple blocks with the tag
.B common
which will be included in all selections;
if any lines appear in
.B plan9.ini
before the first block,
they are treated as a
.B common
block.
.LP
Within the
.B menu
block the following configuration lines are allowed:
.SS \fLmenuitem=tag[, description]
The block identified by
.B tag
will appear in the presented menu.
The menu entry will consist of the
.B tag
unless the optional
.B description
is given.
.SS \fLmenudefault=tag[, timeout]
Identifies a default block to be given in the
menu selection prompt.
If the optional
.B timeout
is given (in seconds),
the default block will be selected if there is no user
input within the timeout period.
.SS \fLmenuconsole=value[, baud]
Selects a serial console upon which to present the menu
as no
.B console
or
.B baud
configuration information will have been processed yet
(the
.B plan9.ini
contents are still to be decided...).
.LP
In response to the menu being printed,
the user is prompted to select a menu item from the list.

.SH BUGS
Being able to set the console device to other than a
display is marginally useful on file servers; MS-DOS
and the programs which run under it are so tightly bound
to the display that it is necessary to have a display if any
setup or reconfiguration programs need to be run.
Also, the delay before any messages appear at boot time
is disconcerting, as any error messages from the BIOS
are lost.
.PP
This idea is at best an interesting experiment that needs another iteration.
