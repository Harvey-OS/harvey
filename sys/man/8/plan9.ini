.TH PLAN9.INI 8
.SH NAME
plan9.ini \- configuration file for PC's
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I none
.SH DESCRIPTION
When booting Plan 9 on a PC, the DOS program
.B b.com
first reads a DOS file
containing configuration information from the boot disk.
This file,
.BR plan9.ini ,
looks like a shell script containing lines of the form
.PP
.EX
	name=\f2value\fP
.EE
.LP
each of which defines a kernel or device parameter.
.PP
For devices, the generic format of
.I value
is
.PP
.EX
	type=TYPE [port=N] [irq=N] [mem=N] [size=N] [dma=N] [ea=N]
.EE
.LP
specifying the controller type,
the base I/O port of the interface, its interrupt
level, the physical starting address of any mapped memory,
the length in bytes of that memory, the DMA channel,
and for Ethernets an override of the physical network address.
Not all elements are relevant to all devices; the relevant values
and their defaults are defined below in the description of each device.
.PP
The file is used by
.B b.com
and the kernel to configure the hardware available.
The information it contains is also passed to the boot
process (see
.IR boot (8))
as environment variables.
The following sections describe how variables are used.
.SS \fLetherX=value\fP
This defines an Ethernet interface.
.IR X ,
a unique monotonically increasing number beginning at 0,
identifies an Ethernet card to be probed at system boot.
Probing stops when a card is found or there is no line for
.BR etherX+1 .
.PP
Some cards are software configurable and do not require all options.
Unspecified options default to the factory defaults.
.PP
Known types are
.TP
.B NE2000
Not software configurable. 16-bit card.
Defaults are
.EX
	port=0x300 irq=2 mem=0x04000 size=0x4000
.EE
.TP
.B NE4100
A PCMCIA version of the NE2000
.TP
.B WD8003
Includes WD8013 and SMC Elite cards. There are varying degrees
of software configurability. Cards may be in either 8-bit or 16-bit slots.
Defaults are
.EX
	port=0x280 irq=3 mem=0xD0000 size=0x2000
.EE
BUG: On many machines only the 16 bit card works.
.TP
.B 3C509
The 3COM 509 (ISA) and 579 (EISA) cards.
Completely configurable, no options need be given.
Port 0x110 is used for the little configuration dance.
.TP
.B 3C589
The 3COM 589 and 589B PCMCIA cards.
Completely configurable, no options need be given.
Defaults are
.EX
	port=0x240 irq=10
.EE
.PP
.SS \fLscsiX=value\fP
This defines a SCSI interface.
.PP
Known types are
.TP
.B aha1542
Adaptec 1542[BC]. This includes other cards that claim to be 1542 compatible;
only the Buslogic 7[45]7[SD], 545C, and 946C have been tried and confirmed.
Defaults are
.EX
	port=0x330 irq=11
.EE
.TP
.B ultra14f
Ultrastor [13]4f. Defaults as for
.BR aha1542 .
.TP
.B bus4201
Buslogic 7[45]7[SD] in 32-bit mode. Defaults as for
.BR aha1542 .
.PP
.SS \fLcdromX=value\fP
This defines a CD-ROM drive connected to a Sound Blaster 16, Pro, MCD, or ACX card.
.PP
Known types are
.TP
.B mitsumi
Mitsumi drive.
Default is
.EX
	port=0x340
.EE
.TP
.B panasonic
Panasonic drive.
Default is
.EX
	port=0x230
.EE
.TP
.B matsushita
Another name for Panasonic.
.PP
.SS \fLserialX=value\fP
This defines add on serial ports and cards.
Multiple cards can share the same IRQ.  Unfortunately,
many PC's allow only the built in UARTs on the
COM1 and COM2 IRQ's (3 & 4) so beware.
.PP
Known types are
.TP
.B mp008
The TTC 8 serial line card.
The
.B mem
parameter is the port number of the interrupt polling port.
.B Size
is the number of UARTs, default 8.
.B Port
is the port number of the first UART.
.TP
.B generic
Any set of 16450 compatible serial lines with consecutive
port addresses.
.B Size
is the number of UARTs, default 1.
.B Port
is the port number of the first UART.
.SS \fLmouseport=value\fP
This specifies where the mouse is attached.
.I Value
can be
.TP
.B ps2
the PS2 mouse/keyboard port.  The BIOS setup procedure
should be used to configure the machine appropriately.
.TP
.B 0
for COM1
.TP
.B 1
for COM2
.SS \fLmodemport=value\fP
Picks the UART line to call out on.
This is used when connecting to a file server over
an async line.
.I Value
is the number of the port.
.SS \fLincondev=value\fP
This specifies which parallel port exists.
0 means LPT1 (default), 1 means LPT2, etc.
.SS \fLspindowntime=value\fP
Some IDE disks, especially those on portables, can be spun
down to conserve power and reduce noise.
Here
.I value
is a decimal number of seconds of inactivity after which
the disk is automatically spun down.
The default is not to spin down the disk.
.SS \fLpcmcia=value\fP
This gives a count of the number of PCMCIA interfaces
installed.
.SS \fLconsole=value\fP
.SS \fLbaud=value\fP
These are used to specify the console device.
The default 
.I console
value is
.IR cga .
Values of
.I 0
or
.I 1
specify
.I COM1
or 
.I COM2
respectively, in which case
.I baud
is used to initialize the port.
.SS \fLbootfile=value\fP
This is used to direct the actions of
.IR b.com (8).
.SS \fLkernelpercent=value\fP
This defines what percentage of available memory is reserved for the kernel allocation pool.
The remainder is left for user processes.  The default
.I value
is
.BR 30 .
.SS \fLmonitor=value\fP
.SS \fLvgasize=value\fP
These are used not by the kernel but by
.IR vga (8).
.SS \fLnvr=value\fP
This is used by a file server kernel to locate a file holding information
to configure the file system.
The file cannot live on a SCSI disk.
The default is
.BR fd!0!plan9.nvr ,
unless
.B bootfile
is set, in which case it is
.B plan9.nvr
on the same disk as
.BR bootfile .
.SS \fLrootdir=value\fP
This names the directory on the root disk
to hold the root of the file system for a Plan 9 kernel using a DOS file system.
The default is the DOS root directory.
.SS \fLaudioX=value\fP
This defines a sound interface.
.PP
Known types are
.TP
.B sb16
Sound Blaster 16.
.PP
The DMA channel may be any of 5, 6, or 7.
The defaults are
.EX
	port=0x220 irq=7 dma=5

.SH BUGS
Being able to set the console device to other than a
display is marginally useful on file servers; MS-DOS
and the programs which run under it are so tightly bound
to the display that it is necessary to have a display if any
setup or reconfiguration programs need to be run.
Also, the delay before any messages appear at boot time
is disconcerting, as any error messages from the BIOS
are lost.
.PP
This idea is at best an interesting experiment that needs another iteration.
