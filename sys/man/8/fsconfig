.SH DESCRIPTION
When a file server's configuration has not been set,
or by explicit request early in the server's initialization (see
.IR fs (8)),
the server enters `config mode'.  The commands described here
apply only in that mode.  They establish configuration constants
that are typically valid for the life of the server, and therefore
need be run only once.  If the non-volatile RAM on the server
gets erased, it will be necessary to recreate the configuration.
.PP
In these commands,
.I ipaddr
is an IP address in the form
.BR 111.103.94.19
and
.I name
is a text string without white space.
The syntax of a
.I device
is more complicated:
.TP
.BI w n1 . n2 . n3
A SCSI disk on target id
.IR n2 ,
unit
.IR n1 ,
and partition
.IR n3 .
A single number specifies a unit, while two numbers specify
.IB unit . partition\f1,
with the missing numbers defaulting to zero.
Any one of the numbers may be replaced by
.BI < m - n >
to represent the values
.I m
through
.I n
inclusive.  For example,
.B (w<1-4>)
is the concatenation of SCSI targets 1 through 4.
.TP
.BI l n1 . n2 . n3
.TP
.BI r n1 . n2 . n3
The same as
.BR w ,
but leaving a single block at the beginning for a label
.BI ( l ),
or not.
These are are only really relevant when used as
.I device3
in the
.B j
device (see below).
.TP
.BI ( device... )
A pseudo-device formed from the concatenation of the
.I devices
in the list.  The devices are
.I not
blank- or comma-separated.
.TP
.BI [ device... ]
A pseudo-device formed from the block-wise interleaving of the
.I devices
in the list.  The size of the result is the number of devices times
the size of the smallest device.
.TP
.BI p device . n1 . n2
A partition starting at
.IR n1 %
from the beginning of
.I device
with a length
.IR n2 %
of the size of the device.
Parenthesize
.I device
if it contains periods.
.TP
.BR j (\f2device1\ device2\f1...)\f2device3
.I Device1
is the SCSI juke box interface.
The
.IR device2 s
are the SCSI drives in the jukebox and
.I device3
represents the demountable platters in the juke box.
.TP
.BI f device
A pseudo-WORM disk: blocks on
.I device
can be written only once and may not be read unless written.
.TP
.BI c device1device2
A cached WORM.  The first
.I device
is the cache, the second the WORM.
.TP
.BI o
(Letter o) The read-only (dump) file system
of the previously defined cached WORM file system.
.PP
The
.B service
command sets the textual name of the server as known in
the network databases.
.PP
The configuration information is stored in block zero on a
device whose device string is written in non-volatile RAM.
The
.B config
command identifies the
.I device
on which the information is recorded.
.PP
The
.I filsys
command configures a file system on
.I device
and calls it
.IR name .
.I Name
is used as the specifier in
.B attach
messages to connect to that file system.
(The file system
.CW main
is the one attached to if the specifier is null; see
.IR attach (5)).
.PP
The
.I ream
command initializes the named file system.  It overwrites
any previous file system on the same device
and creates an empty root directory
on the device.
If
.I name
is
.BR main ,
the file server, until the next reboot,
will accept
.B wstat
messages
(see
.IR stat (5))
that change the owner and group of files,
to enable initializing a fresh file system from a
.IR mkfs (8)
archive.
.PP
For the
.I recover
command, the
named file system
must be a cached WORM.
.I Recover
clears the associated magnetic cache and initializes the file
system, effectively resetting its contents to the last dump.
.PP
The rest of the commands record IP addresses: the file server's address
.RI ( ip ),
the local gateway's
.RI ( ipgw ),
the local authentication server's
.RI ( ipauth ),
the local subnet mask
.RI ( ipmask ),
and the address of a system running an SNTP server.
.I Ipauth
should be
.B 0.0.0.0
if the system is doing its own authentication rather than
calling an external authentication server.
.PP
The various configuration commands only record what to do; they write
no data to disk.  The command
.I end
exits config mode and begins running the file server proper.
The server will then perform whatever I/O is required to establish
the configuration.

Initialize a file server

file system with the cache on the third quarter of the drive
and the pseudo-WORM on the interleave of the first, second, and
fourth quarters.
