.SH DESCRIPTION
When a file server's configuration has not been set,
or by explicit request early in the server's initialization (see
.IR fs (8)),
the server enters `config mode'.  The commands described here
apply only in that mode.  They establish configuration constants
that are typically valid for the life of the server, and therefore
need be run only once.  If the non-volatile RAM on the server
gets erased, it will be necessary to recreate the configuration.
.SS Syntax
In these commands,
.I ipaddr
is an IP address in the form
.BR 111.103.94.19
and
.I name
is a text string without white space.
The syntax of a
.I device
is more complicated:
.TP
.BI w n1 . n2 . n3
Defines a SCSI disk on target (unit) id
.IR n2 ,
controller (host adapter)
.IR n1 ,
and LUN (logical unit number)
.IR n3 .
A single number specifies a target, while two numbers specify
.IB target . lun\f1,
with the missing numbers defaulting to zero.
Any one of the numbers may be replaced by
.BI < m - n >
to represent the values
.I m
through
.I n
inclusive.
.I M
may be greater than
.IR n .
For example,
.B (w<1-4>)
is the concatenation of SCSI targets 1 through 4.
.TP
.BI h n1 . n2 . n3
.I H
is similar to
.IR w ,
but for IDE or ATA disks,
and the controllers must be specified in
.BR plan9.ini .
.I Lun
is ignored.
.I Target
0 is an IDE master
and 1 is a slave.
Instead of specifying
.I controller
and
.IR target
separately,
one may omit the
.I controller
and specify a target of
.IB controller-number *2
.B +
.IR target-number ,
thus
.B h2
is equivalent to
.B h1.0.0
(second IDE controller, master drive).
.TP
.BI l n1 . n2 . n3
.TP
.BI r n1 . n2 . n3
The same as
.BR w ,
but leaving a single block at the beginning for a label
.BI ( l ),
or not.
Only
.I n2
is really of interest,
and refers to a side of a WORM disc.
These are only really relevant when used as
.I device3
in the
.B j
device (see below).
.TP
.BI ( device... )
A pseudo-device formed from the concatenation of the
.I devices
in the list.  The devices are
.I not
blank- or comma-separated.
.TP
.BI [ device... ]
A pseudo-device formed from the block-wise interleaving of the
.I devices
in the list.  The size of the result is the number of devices times
the size of the smallest device.
.TP
.BI { device... }
A pseudo-device formed from the mirroring of the first
.I device
in the list onto all the others.
The size of the result is the size of the smallest device.
One might think of this as RAID 1,
and
.B [
.B ]
as RAID 0.
Each block is written to all the devices,
starting with the rightmost in the list and working leftward.
A block is read from the first device that provides it without error,
starting with the leftmost in the list and working rightward.
.TP
.BI p device . n1 . n2
A partition starting at
.IR n1 %
from the beginning of
.I device
with a length
.IR n2 %
of the size of the device.
Parenthesize
.I device
if it contains periods.
.TP
.BI x device
A pseudo-device that contains the byte-swapped contents of
.IR device .
Since the file server writes integers to disk in its native byte order,
it can be necessary to use this device to read file systems written
by processors of the other byte order.
.TP
.BR j (\f2device1\ device2\f1...)\f2device3
.I Device1
is the SCSI juke box interface.
The
.IR device2 s
are the SCSI drives in the jukebox and
.I device3
represents the demountable platters in the juke box.
.TP
.BI f device
A pseudo-WORM disk: blocks on
.I device
can be written only once and may not be read unless written.
.TP
.BI c device1device2
A cached WORM.  The first
.I device
is the cache, the second the WORM.
.TP
.BI o
(Letter o) The read-only (dump) file system
of the most-recently defined cached WORM file system.
.SS Configuration
The
.B service
command sets the textual name of the server as known in
the network databases.
.PP
The configuration information is stored in block zero on a
device whose device string is written in non-volatile RAM.
The
.B config
and
.B nvram
commands identify the
.I device
on which the information is recorded.
The
.B config
command also erases any previous configuration.
.PP
The
.I filsys
command configures a file system on
.I device
and calls it
.IR name .
.I Name
is used as the specifier in
.B attach
messages to connect to that file system.
(The file system
.B main
is the one attached to if the specifier is null; see
.IR attach (5)).
.PP
The rest of the configuration commands record IP addresses:
the file server's address
.RI ( ip ),
the local gateway's
.RI ( ipgw ),
the local authentication server's
.RI ( ipauth ),
the local subnet mask
.RI ( ipmask ),
and the address of a system running an SNTP server
.RI ( ipsntp ).
.I Ipauth
is no longer used.
If the server has more than one network interface,
a digit may be appended to the keywords
.BR ip ,
.B ipgw
and
.B ipmask
to indicate the interface number;
zero is the default.
.SS "One-time actions"
.PP
The
.I ream
command initializes the named file system.  It overwrites
any previous file system on the same device
and creates an empty root directory
on the device.
If
.I name
is
.BR main ,
the file server, until the next reboot,
will accept
.B wstat
messages
(see
.IR stat (5))
that change the owner and group of files,
to enable initializing a fresh file system from a
.IR mkfs (8)
archive.
.PP
For the
.I recover
command, the
named file system
must be a cached WORM.
.I Recover
clears the associated magnetic cache and initializes the file
system, effectively resetting its contents to the last dump.
.PP
.I Allow
turns off all permission checking; use with caution.
.PP
.I Readonly
disables all writing to all devices.
This is useful for trying dangerous experiments.
.PP
.I Noauth
disables authentication.
.PP
.I Noattach
prevents attachs.
.PP
.I Copyworm
will copy a file system named
.I main
to one named
.IR output ,
block by block,
and loop.
It knows how to read a fake worm file system.
.PP
.I Halt
will cause the server to
.I immediately
exit and reboot.
.PP
The various configuration commands only record what to do; they write
no data to disk.  The command
.I end
exits config mode and begins running the file server proper.
The server will then perform whatever I/O is required to establish
the configuration.
.SH EXAMPLE
Initialize a file server
.B kgbsun
with a single file system interleaved between SCSI targets 3 and 4.

.PP
Initialize a file server
.B kremvax
with a single disk on target 0 partitioned as a cached pseudo-WORM
file system with the cache on the third quarter of the drive
and the pseudo-WORM on the interleave of the first, second, and
fourth quarters.
.IP
.EX

.PP
A complete and complex example:
initialize a file server
.I fsb
with a single SCSI disk on target 0 for a scratch file system,
a cached WORM file system with cache disk on target 2 and
an optical-disc jukebox on targets 4 (robotics) and 5 (one optical drive),
and another cached WORM file system with cache disk on target 3
and another optical-disc jukebox on a second SCSI bus at targets 3 and 4.
Both jukeboxes contain 16 slots of optical discs.
It has two Ethernet interfaces and can reach an SNTP server on the first one.
