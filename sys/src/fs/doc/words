'emelie' is for any PC with supported hardware excluding the SONY
jukebox, and will make an object '9emeliefs' and use a 16KB block
size.  It's set up for the US Eastern time zone.  choline is similar,
but with conf.nfile cranked up.

fs uses a 4KB block size, rereads all blocks written to the WORM, and
is configured for the US Pacific time zone and with more `large
message' buffers than is usual (for gigabit Ethernet).  fs64 is
similar but uses an 8KB block size and 64-bit (rather than 32-bit)
file sizes, offsets and block numbers, and consequently can only serve
9P2000, not 9P1.

9netics32.16k is like fs, but uses a 16KB block size and does not
reread blocks written to the WORM.  9netics64.8k is like fs64, but
uses an 8KB block size and does not reread blocks written to the WORM.

To spin-off a new version to play with, say 'test':

	cd /sys/src/fs
	mkdir test
	cp emelie/9emeliefs.c test/9testfs.c
	cp emelie/dat.h emelie/fns.h emelie/io.h emelie/mem.h test
	sed '1s/emelie/test/' <emelie/mkfile >test/mkfile

and hack as appropriate.

The mkfiles aren't quite right yet to make this as automatic as it
should be.  There are a lot of rough edges.
