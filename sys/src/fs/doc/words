'emelie' is for any PC with supported hardware excluding the SONY
jukebox, and will make an object '9emeliefs' and use a 16KB block size.

To spin-off a new version to play with, say 'test':

	cd /sys/src/fs
	mkdir test
	cp emelie/9emeliefs.c test/9testfs.c
	cp emelie/dat.h emelie/fns.h emelie/io.h emelie/mem.h test
	sed '1s/emelie/test/' <emelie/mkfile >test/mkfile

and hack as appropriate.

The mkfiles aren't quite right yet to make this as automatic as it
should be.  There are a lot of rough edges.
