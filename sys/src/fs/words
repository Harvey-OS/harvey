This is an intermediate version of the fileserver kernel.

'emelie' is for any PC with supported hardware excluding the SONY jukebox,
and will make an object '9pcfs'.
'sony' is the same but has the SONY jukebox code instead of the HP code,
and will make an object '9sonyfs'.
Both use a 16KB block size.

To spin-off a new version to play with, say 'test':
	cd /sys/src/fs
	mkdir test
	cp emelie/9pcfs.c test/9testfs.c
	cp emelie/dat.h emelie/fns.h emelie/io.h emelie/mem.h test
	sed '1s/pc/test/' <emelie/mkfile >test/mkfile
and hack as appropriate.

The mkfiles aren't quite right yet to make this as automatic as it
should be. There are a lot of rough edges.
