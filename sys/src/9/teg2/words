this is a plan 9 port to the Compulab Trimslice using Nvidia's tegra2 soc:
a dual-core, dual-issue, out-of-order, speculative-execution 1GHz Cortex-A9
MPcore r1p0 system (v7-a arch.).  it prefetches speculatively and
aggressively.  it's no xeon, though.

dram is 1GB at 0.
has vfp 3 floating-point.
linux believes that u-boot runs in the bottom 4MB, and u-boot sets
loadaddr to 0x408000.

l1 & l2 caches are kept coherent by scu (snoop control unit) hardware once
CpACsmpcoher is set.  NB: v7 arch allows few L1 cache ops, mainly
invalidation.  the l2 cache (pl310 r2p0) is a non-architectural bag nailed
on the side, but the scu even coordinates with it.

nvidia says that the tegra 2 includes the acp (accelerator coherency port),
which should reduce the cost of dma by eliminating the need for cache
maintainence around it, but it isn't obvious how to invoke the acp and
experimentation failed.

mp arm systems have a generic interrupt controller; this one is gic
v1(!) similar to pl390.  has trustzone (secure & non-secure modes),
security extensions, 31 lspi (lockable irqs) and 160 itlines (5
interrupt controllers), including local interrupts.  we use the secure
world exclusively, ignoring the non-secure world and all hypervisor hooks.

everything has errata (hardware bugs); the notable docs are from arm
for the cortex-a9, pl310 l2 cache and gic v1 interrupt controller.

uarts are numbered 1-5, also known as a-e, respectively.  uart1 (a.k.a.
uarta) is connected to the front at P3, an ultra mini connector.

section numbers (§) are in the tegra 2 tech. ref. man.
for a minimal cpu server, need these devices to work:
	clock signals §5 (leave to u-boot),
	pad mux + gpio crap §8, §11 and §18 (leave to u-boot),
☑	1 cpu §13,
☑	uart (16[45]50) §22,
☑	gic (gic.v1.pdf),
☑	clock §6—7,
☑	ether8169 via pcie §31.
then add these:
☑	2nd cpu (cortex.a9.mpcore.pdf),
☑	l2 cache (l2cache.pl310.pdf, errata),
☑	fpu (cortex.a9.fp.pdf),
☑	user profiling,
☑	kprof (needed small fix to kprof(1)),
	in-line 64-bit arithmetic,
eventually might want:
	usb (e.g., for sata) §26,
	nor flash §17,
	video §29,
and the really horrid ones:
	nand flash §16,
	mmc §25.
