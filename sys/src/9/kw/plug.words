marvell 88f6281 (feroceon kirkwood) SoC
arm926ej-s rev 1 [56251311] (armv5tejl) 1.2GHz cpu

l1 I & D VIVT caches 16K each: 4-way, 128 sets, 32-byte lines
	l1 D is write-through, l1 I is write-back
unified l2 PIPT cache 256K: 4-way, 2048 sets, 32-byte lines
	potentially 512K: 8-way

apparently the mmu walks the page tables in dram and won't look in the
l2 cache.  there is no hardware cache coherence, thus the l1 caches
need to be flushed or invalidated when mmu mappings change, but l2
only needs to be flushed or invalidated around dma operations and page
table changes, and only the affected dma buffers and descriptors or
page table entries need to be flushed or invalidated in l2.

we arrange that device registers are uncached.

be aware that cache operations act on cache lines (of CACHELINESZ
bytes) as atomic units, so if you invalidate 4 caches of a cache line,
you invalidate the entire cache line, whether it's been written back
(is clean) or not (is dirty).  mixed data structures with parts
maintained by hardware and other parts by software are especially
tricky.  we try to pad the initial hardware parts so that the software
parts start in a new cache line.

there are no video controllers so far, so this port is a cpu
kernel only.

If you plan to use flash, it would be wise to avoid touching the first
megabyte, which contains u-boot, right up to 0x100000.  There's a
linux kernel from there to 0x400000, if you care.  You'll also likely
want to use paqfs rather than fossil or kfs for file systems in flash
since there is no wear-levelling.

The code is fairly heavy-handed with the use of barrier instructions
(BARRIERS in assembler, coherence in C), partly in reaction to bad
experience doing Power PC ports, but also just as precautions against
modern processors, which may feel free to execute instructions out of
order or some time later, store to memory out of order or some time
later, otherwise break the model of traditional sequential processors,
or any combination of the above.

this plan 9 port is based on the port of native inferno to the
sheevaplug by Salva Peir√≥ (saoret.one@gmail.com) and Mechiel Lukkien
(mechiel@ueber.net).
