___
The state of the Beagleboard/IGEPv2 (TI OMAP35 SoC, Cortex-A8) port.

Plan 9 runs on the IGEPv2 board.

On the Beagleboard, Plan 9 is not yet usable but it gets as far as
trying to access the USB ethernet (since the Beagleboard has no
built-in ethernet and must use USB ethernet).

IGEP Ethernet

The igep's smsc9221 ethernet consumes a lot of system time.  The
design decision to use fifos rather than buffer rings and to not
incorporate dma into the ethernet controller is probably responsible.
With only a single core, running the 9221 consumes a lot of the
available CPU time.  It's probably worth trying to use the system dma
controller again.

USB

The ohci and ehci controllers are seen, but no devices yet.

There are four USB errata that need to be looked into for the igepv2
(silicon 3.1) at least.  From the omap3530 errata (rev e):

- 3.1.1.130 only one usb dma channel (rx or tx) can be active
	at one time: use interrupt mode instead
- 3.1.1.144 otg soft reset doesn't work right
- 3.1.1.183 ohci and ehci controllers cannot work concurrently
- §3.1.3 usb limitations: all ports must be configured to identical speeds
	(high vs full/low)

Flash

access to nand or spi flash would be handy for nvram and small
fossils.  flash access isn't well documented.  inferno implements
these software layers: ecc, translation (for wear-levelling and bad
sectors), common flash code and specific drivers for flash chips.

VFPv3 Floating Point

The Cortex-A8 has VFPv3 floating point, which uses different opcodes
than 5c/5l currently generate.  New 5c or 5l is in the works.

Video

The video controller may be documented and source is available for a
Linux driver.

There are a few rough edges:

- the clock.c scheduling rate (HZ) is quite approximate.  The OMAP
timers are complex, but one could eventually do better (or just let
timesync compensate).

- Serial console printing is rudimentary.  I tried repeatedly to hook
into devuart, but failed.  "g 'CRUDEPRINT|LASTRESORT' ." should find
the workarounds.

- User processes are limited to 512MB (mainly by the IGEPv2 Ethernet
being at 0x2c000000), which isn't a problem since Beagleboards only
have 256MB of dram and IGEPv2s have 512MB.

- might use ucalloc.c to allocate uncached scratch space for generated code
in coproc.c.

- the C implementation of cache primitives failed with mmu off; still true?

- unlock, setup: protect module register target APE (PM_RT) per spruf98c §1.6.7

- setup mpp (multi-purpose pins)?
