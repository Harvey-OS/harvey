___
The state of the Beagleboard/IGEPv2 (TI OMAP35 SoC, Cortex-A8) port.

Plan 9 runs on the IGEPv2 and Gumstix Overo boards.

On the Beagleboard, Plan 9 is not yet usable but it gets as far as
trying to access the USB ethernet (since the Beagleboard has no
built-in ethernet and must use USB ethernet).

IGEP & Gumstix Ethernet

The smsc9221 ethernet consumes a lot of system time.  The design
decision to use fifos rather than buffer rings and to not incorporate
dma into the ethernet controller is probably responsible.  With only a
single core, running the 9221 consumes a lot of the available CPU
time.  It's probably worth trying to use the system dma controller again.

USB

The ohci and ehci controllers are seen, but no devices yet.

There are four USB errata that need to be looked into for the igepv2
(silicon 3.1) at least.  From the omap3530 errata (rev e):

- 3.1.1.130 only one usb dma channel (rx or tx) can be active
	at one time: use interrupt mode instead
- 3.1.1.144 otg soft reset doesn't work right
- 3.1.1.183 ohci and ehci controllers cannot work concurrently
- §3.1.3 usb limitations: all ports must be configured to identical speeds
	(high vs full/low)

Flash

access to nand flash would be handy for nvram and paqfs or sacfs file
systems.

In the flash, x-loader occupies up to 0x20000, then u-boot from
0x80000 to 0x1e0000, and there's a linux kernel after that (if you
care).  The beagle's flash chip is a micron pop 2Gb nand
mt29f2g16abdhc-et (physical marking jw256), and the igep's is a
samsung onenand.

VFPv3 Floating Point

The Cortex-A8 has VFPv3 floating point, which uses different opcodes
than 5c/5l currently generate.  New 5c or 5l is in the works.

Video

The display subsystem for omap3 (dss) is divided into 3 parts, called lcd,
video and dsi (ignoring the various accelerators).  The system only
supports the lcd via dvi interface so far because it's the only one we
have been able to test.  1280x1024x16 is the default resolution, this
might be changed.  Writing to /dev/dssctl (e.g., echo 1024x768x16
>/dev/dssctl) changes the resolution.  Currently the system does not
use the rfbi since it seems like an unnecessary optimisation at this
point.  Per Odlund wrote the first draft of the video driver for a
Google Summer of Code project.

Stray Interrupts

IRQs 56 and 57 are I2C.  83, 86 and 94 are MMC.

___

The code is fairly heavy-handed with the use of barrier instructions
(BARRIERS in assembler, coherence in C), partly in reaction to bad
experience doing Power PC ports, but also just as precautions against
modern processors, which may feel free to execute instructions out of
order or some time later, store to memory out of order or some time
later, otherwise break the model of traditional sequential processors,
or any combination of the above.
___

There are a few rough edges:

- the clock.c scheduling rate (HZ) is quite approximate.  The OMAP
timers are complex, but one could eventually do better (or just let
timesync compensate).

- User processes are limited to 512MB virtual (mainly by the IGEPv2 Ethernet
being at 0x2c000000), which isn't a problem since Beagleboards only
have 256MB of dram and IGEPv2s have 512MB, and we don't want to swap.

- might use ucalloc.c to allocate uncached scratch space for generated code
in coproc.c.

- the C implementation of cache primitives failed with mmu off; still true?

- unlock, setup: protect module register target APE (PM_RT) per spruf98c §1.6.7

- setup mpp (multi-purpose pins)?
