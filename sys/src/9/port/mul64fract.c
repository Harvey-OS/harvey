 * Multiply two 64 numbers and return the middle 64 bits of the 128 bit result.
 *
 * The assumption is that one of the numbers is a
 * fixed point number with the integer portion in the
 * high word and the fraction in the low word.
 *
 * There should be an assembler version of this routine
 * for each architecture.  This one is intended to
 * make ports easier.
