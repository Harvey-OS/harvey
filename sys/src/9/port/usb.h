 * Services provided by the driver.
 * epopen allocates hardware structures to prepare the endpoint
 * for I/O. This happens when the user opens the data file.
 * epclose releases them. This happens when the data file is closed.
 * epwrite tries to write the given bytes, waiting until all of them
 * have been written (or failed) before returning; but not for Iso.
 * epread does the same for reading.
 * It can be assumed that endpoints are DMEXCL but concurrent
 * read/writes may be issued and the controller must take care.
 * For control endpoints, device-to-host requests must be followed by
 * a read of the expected length if needed.
 * The port requests are called when usbd issues commands for root
 * hubs. Port status must return bits as a hub request would do.
 * Toggle handling and other details are left for the controller driver
 * to avoid mixing too much the controller and the comon device.
 * While an endpoint is closed, its toggles are saved in the Ep struct.
