 * Intel-like machines (PCs, Sequent)
 * pack bytes from low to high (the are little-endian).
 * Use the LowHigh routines to match the native format

 *
 * These routines have been tested on the following machines:
 *	Apple Macintosh, MPW 3.1 C compiler
 *	Apple Macintosh, THINK C compiler
 *	Silicon Graphics IRIS, MIPS compiler
 *	Cray X/MP and Y/MP

 *
 *
 * Implemented by Malcolm Slaney and Ken Turkowski.
 *
 * Malcolm Slaney contributions during 1988-1990 include big- and little-

 *
 * In 1991, Ken Turkowski implemented the conversions to and from
