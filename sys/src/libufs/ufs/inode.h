/*
 * The inode is used to describe each active (or recently active) file in the
 * UFS filesystem. It is composed of two types of information. The first part
 * is the information that is needed only while the file is active (such as
 * the identity of the file and linkage to speed its lookup). The second part
 * is the permanent meta-data associated with the file which is read in
 * from the permanent dinode from long term storage when the file becomes
 * active, and is put back when the file is no longer being used.
 *
 * An inode may only be changed while holding either the exclusive
 * vnode lock or the shared vnode lock and the vnode interlock. We use
 * the latter only for "read" and "get" operations that require
 * changing i_flag, or a timestamp. This locking protocol allows executing
 * those operations without having to upgrade the vnode lock from shared to
 * exclusive.
