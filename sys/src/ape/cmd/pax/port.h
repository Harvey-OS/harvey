 *	Header for maintaing portablilty across operating system and
 *	version boundries.  For the most part, this file contains
 *	definitions which map functions which have the same functionality
 *	but different names on different systems, to have the same name.

 * Everybody does wait() differently.  There seem to be no definitions for
 * this in V7 (e.g. you are supposed to shift and mask things out using
 * constant shifts and masks.)  In order to provide the functionality, here
 * are some non standard but portable macros.  Don't change to a "union wait"
 * based approach -- the ordering of the elements of the struct depends on the
 * byte-sex of the machine.
