/* open_tty - open the terminal for interactive queries
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * 	Assumes that background processes ignore interrupts and that the
 *	open() or the isatty() will fail for processes which are not
 *	attached to terminals. Returns a file descriptor or -1 if
 *	unsuccessful.
 *
 * RETURNS
 *
 *	Returns a file descriptor which can be used to read and write
 *	directly to the user's terminal, or -1 on failure.
 *
 * ERRORS
 *
 *	If SIGINT cannot be ignored, or the open fails, or the newly opened
 *	terminal device is not a tty, then open_tty will return a -1 to the
 *	caller.

/* nextask - ask a question and get a response
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Give the user a prompt and wait for their response.  The prompt,
 *	located in "msg" is printed, then the user is allowed to type
 *	a response to the message.  The first "limit" characters of the
 *	user response is stored in "answer".
 *
 *	Nextask ignores spaces and tabs.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *
 *	char *msg	- Message to display for user
 *	char *answer	- Pointer to user's response to question
 *	int limit	- Limit of length for user's response
 *
 * RETURNS
 *
 *	Returns the number of characters in the user response to the
 *	calling function.  If an EOF was encountered, a -1 is returned to
 *	the calling function.  If an error occured which causes the read
 *	to return with a value of -1, then the function will return a
 *	non-zero return status to the calling process, and abort
 *	execution.

 *	Prompts the user to replace the backup medium with a new volume

 *	archiving to a file on a hard disk, that the message can be a
 *	little surprising.  Assumes that background processes ignore
