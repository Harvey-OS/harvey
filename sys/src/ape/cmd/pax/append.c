/* append_archive - main loop for appending to a tar archive
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Append_archive reads an archive until the end of the archive is
 *	reached once the archive is reached, the buffers are reset and the
 *	create_archive function is called to handle the actual writing of
 *	the appended archive data.  This is quite similar to the
 *	read_archive function, however, it does not do all the processing.
