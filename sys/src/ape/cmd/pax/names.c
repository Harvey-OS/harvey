 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * 	Look up a user name from a uid/gid, maintaining a cache.

 * PARAMETERS
 *
 *	char	uname[]		- name (to be returned to user)
 *	int	uuid		- id of name to find
 *
 *
 * RETURNS
 *
 *	Returns a name which is associated with the user id given.  If there
 *	is not name which corresponds to the user-id given, then a pointer
 *	to a string of zero length is returned.
 *	
 * FIXME
 *
 * 	1. for now it's a one-entry cache. 
 *	2. The "-993" is to reduce the chance of a hit on the first lookup.
