 *
 * 	limits.h - POSIX compatible defnitions for some of <limits.h>
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * 	We need to include <limits.h> if this system is being compiled with an 
 * 	ANSI standard C compiler, or if we are running on a POSIX confomrming 
 * 	system.  If the manifest constant _POSIX_SOURCE is not defined when 
 * 	<limits.h> is included, then none of the POSIX constants are defined 
 *	and we need to define them here.  It's a bit wierd, but it works.
 *
 * 	These values where taken from the IEEE P1003.1 standard, draft 12.
 * 	All of the values below are the MINIMUM values allowed by the standard.
 * 	Not all values are used by the PAX program, but they are included for
 * 	completeness, and for support of future enhancements.  Please see
 * 	section 2.9 of the draft standard for more information on the following
 * 	constants.
