/* Find the midpoint of the shortest edit script for a specified
   portion of the two files.

   Scan from the beginnings of the files, and simultaneously from the ends,
   doing a breadth-first search through the space of edit-sequence.
   When the two searches meet, we have found the midpoint of the shortest
   edit sequence.

   If MINIMAL is nonzero, find the minimal edit script regardless
   of expense.  Otherwise, if the search is too expensive, use
   heuristics to stop the search and report a suboptimal answer.

   Set PART->(XMID,YMID) to the midpoint (XMID,YMID).  The diagonal number
   XMID - YMID equals the number of inserted lines minus the number
   of deleted lines (counting only lines before the midpoint).
   Return the approximate edit cost; this is the total number of
   lines inserted or deleted (counting only lines before the midpoint),
   unless a heuristic is used to terminate the search prematurely.

   Set PART->LEFT_MINIMAL to nonzero iff the minimal edit script for the
   left half of the partition is known; similarly for PART->RIGHT_MINIMAL.

   This function assumes that the first lines of the specified portions
   of the two files do not match, and likewise that the last lines do not
   match.  The caller must trim matching lines from the beginning and end
   of the portions it is going to specify.

   If we return the "wrong" partitions,
   the worst this can do is cause suboptimal diff output.
   It cannot cause incorrect diff output.  */
