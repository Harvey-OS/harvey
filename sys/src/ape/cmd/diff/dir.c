/* Compare the contents of two directories named in FILEVEC[0] and FILEVEC[1].
   This is a top-level routine; it does everything necessary for diff
   on two directories.

   FILEVEC[0].desc == -1 says directory FILEVEC[0] doesn't exist,
   but pretend it is empty.  Likewise for FILEVEC[1].

   HANDLE_FILE is a caller-provided subroutine called to handle each file.
   It gets five operands: dir and name (rel to original working dir) of file
   in dir 0, dir and name pathname of file in dir 1, and the recursion depth.

   For a file that appears in only one of the dirs, one of the name-args
   to HANDLE_FILE is zero.

   DEPTH is the current depth in recursion, used for skipping top-level
   files by the -S option.

   Returns the maximum of all the values returned by HANDLE_FILE,
   or 2 if trouble is encountered in opening files.  */
