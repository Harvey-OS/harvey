This is a Plan 9 port of pdksh version 5.2.14, a public
domain implementation of the Korn shell.

The entirety of the code is in the public domain.
There were two non-public domain pieces (sigact.[ch]
and aclocal.m4) but they are gone.

This has not been significantly tested under Plan 9 for
lack (not want) of a complete Perl distribution with
which to run the test suite.

THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE PDKSH DISTRIBUTION.
This is only the source code required to compile and
run the shell under Plan 9.  For revision history and
any other information, look at the web page mentioned
in the README file.

12 June 2000: rsc: Added -I flag so you can 
	bind pdksh over rc for use in mk,
	a dubious justification.
