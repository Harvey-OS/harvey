 * pANS stdio -- tmpfile
 *
 * Bug: contains a critical section.  Two executions by the same
 * user could interleave as follows, both yielding the same file:
 *	access fails
 *			access fails
 *	fopen succeeds
 *			fopen succeeds
 *	unlink succeeds
 *			unlink fails
 * As I read the pANS, this can't reasonably use tmpnam to generate
 * the name, so that code is duplicated.
