Command:    as  -  assembler

AS -- --ASSEMBLER  [IBM]

     This  document  describes  the  language  accepted  by  the   80386
assembler  that  is  part of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit.  Note that only
the syntax is described, only  a  few  386  instructions  are  shown  as
examples.

Tokens,  Numbers,  Character  Constants,  and  Strings

     The syntax of numbers is the same as in C.  The constants 32,  040,
and  0x20  all  represent  the  same number, but are written in decimal,
octal, and hex, respectively.  The rules  for  character  constants  and
strings  are  also  the  same  as in C.  For example, 'a' is a character
constant.  A typical string is "string".  Expressions may be formed with
C  operators, but must use [ and ] for parentheses.  (Normal parentheses
are claimed by the operand syntax.)

Symbols

     Symbols contain letters  and  digits,  as  well  as  three  special
characters:  dot, tilde, and underscore.  The first character may not be
a digit or tilde.

     The names of the 80386 registers are reserved.  These are:

   al, bl, cl, dl
   ah, bh, ch, dh
   ax, bx, cx, dx, eax, ebx, ecx, edx
   si, di, bp, sp, esi, edi, ebp, esp
   cs, ds, ss, es, fs, gs

The xx and exx variants of the eight general registers  are  treated  as
synonyms  by the assembler.  Normally "ax" is the 16-bit low half of the
32-bit "eax" register.  The assembler determines  if  a  16  or  32  bit
operation  is  meant  solely  by  looking  at  the  instruction  or  the
instruction prefixes.  It is however best to use  the  proper  registers
when writing assembly to not confuse those who read the code.

The last group of 6 segment registers are used  for  selector  +  offset
mode  addressing, in which the effective address is at a given offset in
one of the 6 segments.

     Names of instructions and pseudo-ops are not  reserved.  Alphabetic
characters in opcodes and pseudo-ops must be in lower case.

Separators
     Commas, blanks, and tabs are separators  and  can  be  interspersed
freely  between  tokens,  but  not within tokens.  Commas are only legal
between operands.

Comments

     The comment character is '!'. The rest of the line is ignored.

Opcodes

     The opcodes are listed below.  Notes: (1) Different names  for  the
same  instruction  are  separated  by  '/'.   (2)  Square  brackets ([])
indicate that 0 or 1 of the enclosed characters can  be  included.   (3)
Curly  brackets  ({})  work  similarly,  except that one of the enclosed
characters must
 be included.  Thus square brackets indicate  an  option,
whereas curly brackets indicate that a choice must be made.

Control  Transfer

     As
 accepts a number of special jump opcodes that  can  assemble  to
instructions  with  either  a byte displacement, which can only reach to
targets within -126 to +129 bytes of the branch, or an instruction  with
a  32-bit  displacement.   The assembler automatically chooses a byte or
word displacement instruction.

     The English translation of the  opcodes  should  be  obvious,  with
'l(ess)'  and  'g(reater)'  for  signed  comparisions, and 'b(elow)' and
'a(bove)*(CQ for unsigned comparisions.  There are lots of  synonyms  to
allow you to write "jump if not that" instead of "jump if this".

     The  'call',  'jmp',  and  'ret'   instructions   can   be   either
intrasegment  or  intersegment.  The intersegment versions are indicated
with the suffix 'f'.

Unconditional

  jmp[f]  dest          ! jump to dest (8 or 32-bit displacement)
  call[f] dest          ! call procedure
  ret[f]                ! return from procedure

Conditional

  ja/jnbe               ! if above/not below or equal (unsigned)
  jae/jnb/jnc           ! if above or equal/not below/not carry (uns.)
  jb/jnae/jc            ! if not above nor equal/below/carry (unsigned)
  jbe/jna               ! if below or equal/not above (unsigned)
  jg/jnle               ! if greater/not less nor equal (signed)
  jge/jnl               ! if greater or equal/not less (signed)
  jl/jnqe               ! if less/not greater nor equal (signed)

  jns                   ! if sign not set
  js                    ! if sign set

Iteration  Control

  jcxz    dest          ! jump if ECX = 0
  loop    dest          ! Decrement ECX and jump if CX != 0
  loope/loopz dest      ! Decrement ECX and jump if ECX = 0 and ZF = 1
  loopne/loopnz dest    ! Decrement ECX and jump if ECX != 0 and ZF = 0

Interrupt

  int     n             ! Software interrupt n
  into                  ! Interrupt if overflow set
  iretd                 ! Return from interrupt

Flag  Operations

  clc                   ! Clear carry flag
  cld                   ! Clear direction flag
  cli                   ! Clear interrupt enable flag
  cmc                   ! Complement carry flag
  stc                   ! Set carry flag
  std                   ! Set direction flag
  sti                   ! Set interrupt enable flag

Location  Counter

     The special symbol '.' is the location counter and its value is the
address of the first byte of the instruction in which the symbol appears
and can be used in expressions.

Segments

     There are four different assembly segments:  text,  rom,  data  and
bss.   Segments are declared and selected by the . sect
 pseudo-op.  It is
customary to declare all segments at the top of an  assembly  file  like
this:

   .sect .text; .sect .rom; .sect .data; .sect .bss

The assembler accepts up to 16 different  segments,  but  MINIX  expects
only  four  to be used.  Anything can in principle be assembled into any
segment, but the MINIX bss segment may only contain uninitialized  data.
Note that the '.' symbol refers to the location in the current segment.

Labels

     There are two types: name and numeric.  Name labels  consist  of  a
name followed by a colon (:).

     The numeric labels are single digits.  The nearest 0: label may  be
referenced as 0f in the forward direction, or 0b backwards.

Statement  Syntax

     Each line consists of a single statement.  Blank or  comment  lines
are allowed.

Instruction  Statements

     The most general form of an instruction is

   label: opcode operand1, operand2    ! comment

Expression  Semantics

     The following operators can be used:  + - * / & |  ^  ~  <<  (shift
left)  >>  (shift  right) - (unary minus).  32-bit integer arithmetic is
used. Division produces a truncated quotient.

Addressing  Modes

     Below is a list of the addressing modes  supported.   Each  one  is
followed by an example.

   constant                         mov eax, 123456
   direct access                    mov eax, (counter)
   register                         mov eax, esi
   indirect                         mov eax, (esi)
   base + disp.                     mov eax, 6(ebp)
   scaled index                     mov eax, (4*esi)
   base + index                     mov eax, (ebp)(2*esi)
   base + index + disp.             mov eax, 10(edi)(1*esi)

Any of the constants or  symbols  may  be  replacement  by  expressions.
Direct   access,   constants  and  displacements  may  be  any  type  of
expression.  A scaled index with scale 1  may  be  written  without  the
'1*'.

Call  and  Jmp

     The 'call' and 'jmp' instructions can be interpreted as a load into
the instruction pointer.

   call _routine                    ! Direct, intrasegment
   call (subloc)                    ! Indirect, intrasegment
   call 6(ebp)                      ! Indirect, intrasegment
   call ebx                         ! Direct, intrasegment
   call (ebx)                       ! Indirect, intrasegment
   callf (subloc)                   ! Indirect, intersegment
   callf seg:offs                   ! Direct, intersegment

Symbol  Assigment

     Symbols can acquire values in one of two ways.  Using a symbol as a
label  sets  it  to  '.'  for the current segment with type relocatable.
Alternative, a symbol may be given a name via an assignment of the form

   symbol = expression

in which the symbol is assigned the value and type of its arguments.

Storage  Allocation

     Space can be reserved for bytes, words, and longs using pseudo-ops.
They take one or more operands, and for each generate a value whose size
is a byte, word (2 bytes) or long (4 bytes).  For example:

  .data1 2, 6           ! allocate 2 bytes initialized to 2 and 6
  .data2 3, 0x10        ! allocate 2 words initialized to 3 and 16
  .data4 010            ! allocate a longword initialized to 8
  .space 40             ! allocates 40 bytes of zeros

allocates 50 (decimal) bytes of  storage,  initializing  the  first  two
bytes to 2 and 6, the next two words to 3 and 16, then one longword with
value 8 (010 octal), last 40 bytes of zeros.

String  Allocation

     The pseudo-ops . ascii  and  . asciz
  take  one  string  argument  and
generate  the  ASCII  character codes for the letters in the string. The
latter automatically terminates the string with a null  (0)  byte.   For
example,

   .ascii "hello"
   .asciz "world\n"

Alignment
     Sometimes it is necessary to force the next  item  to  begin  at  a
word, longword or even a 16 byte address boundary.  The . align
 pseudo-op
zero or more null byte if the current location  is  a  multiple  of  the
argument of .align.

Segment  Control

     Every item assembled goes in one of the four segments:  text,  rom,
data,  or  bss.  By using the . sect  pseudo-op with argument . text
, . rom,
. data  or . bss
, the programmer can force  the  next  items  to  go  in  a
particular segment.

External  Names

     A symbol can be given global scope by including  it  in  a  .
define
pseudo-op.   Multiple  names may be listed, separate by commas.  It must
be used to export symbols defined in the  current  program.   Names  not
defined  in  the  current  program  are  treated as "undefined external"
automatically, although it is customary to make this explicit  with  the
. extern  pseudo-op.

Common

     The . comm
 pseudo-op declares storage that can  be  common  to  more
than  one  module.   There  are  two  arguments:  a name and an absolute
expression giving the size in bytes of the area named by the symbol. The
type  of  the  symbol becomes external.  The statement can appear in any
segment.  If you think this has something to do with  FORTRAN,  you  are
right.

Examples

     In the kernel directory, there are several assembly code files that
are  worth  inspecting as examples.  However, note that these files, are
designed to first be run through the C preprocessor.   (The  very  first
character is a # to signal this.)  Thus they contain numerous constructs
that are not pure assembler.  For true assembler examples, compile any C
program  provided  with MINIX using the -S
 flag.  This will result in an
assembly language file with a suffix with the same name as the C  source
file, but ending with the .s suffix.
