This directory contains the dregs of a (so far) failed attempt to decrypt and set
the proprietary ATI registers.    The diff output of the vga command shows that
three or four of their known registers don't get set to the values they have
when properly set under dos.  Perhaps we set them in the wrong order.  Perhaps
Some register unlocks them.  If you have lots of spare time and an ATI board,
your efforts are welcome.
