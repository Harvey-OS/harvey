Thank you for this program.  Thank you very much!  Thank you immensely!!


P.S.  I find entry helpful as a /etc/mailcap rule:

application/msword;/usr/local/bin/antiword -t %s | less; needsterminal; \
copiousoutput; print=antiword -p letter %s|lpr

I completely integrates the text mode with my mailer, exmh.  You might
want to include it in your documentation.
