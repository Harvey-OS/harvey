.SH FILES
.TP
Mapping files like 8859-1.txt
.br
Antiword looks for its mapping files in three directories, in the order given:
.br
(1) The directory specified by $ANTIWORDHOME
.br
(2) The directory specified by $HOME/.antiword
.br
(3) Directory /usr/share/antiword
.TP
The fontnames file
.br
Antiword will look for its fontname file in the same directories as used for the
mapping files.
.br
The fontnames file contains the translation table from font names used by MS
Word to font names used by PostScript.
.TP
NOTE:
.br
Antiword cannot tell the difference between a file that does not exist and a
file that cannot be opened for reading.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Antiword uses the environment variable ``ANTIWORDHOME'' as the first directory
to look for its files. Antiword uses the environment variable ``HOME'' to find
the user's home directory. When in text mode it uses the variable ``COLUMNS''
to set the width of the output (unless overridden by the -w option).
.SH BUGS
Antiword is far from complete. Many features are still missing. Many images are
not shown yet. Some of the images that are shown, are shown in the wrong place.
PostScript output is only available in ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-2.
