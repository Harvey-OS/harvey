NAME
       antiword - show the text and images of MS Word documents

SYNOPSIS
       antiword [ options ] wordfiles

DESCRIPTION
       Antiword  is an application that displays the text and the
       images of Microsoft Word documents.
       A wordfile named - stands for a Word  document  read  from
       the standard input.
       Only  documents made by MS Word version 2 and version 6 or
       later are supported.

OPTIONS
       -h     Give a help message.

       -i image level
              The image  level  determines  how  images  will  be
              shown.

              0: Use  non-standard  extensions  from Ghostscript.
                 This output may  not  print  on  any  PostScript
                 printer,  but  is useful in case no hard copy is
                 needed. It is also useful  when  Ghostscript  is
                 used as a filter to print a PostScript file to a
                 non-PostScript printer.

              1: Show no images.

              2: PostScript level 2 compatible. (default)

              3: PostScript level  3  compatible.  (EXPERIMENTAL,
                 Portable  Network  Graphics (PNG) images are not
                 printed correctly)

       -m mapping file
              This file is used to map Unicode characters to your
              local  character  set.  The default is UTF-8.txt in
              locales that support UTF-8 and 8859-1.txt in  other
              locales.

       -p papersize
              Output  in  PostScript  form. Printable on paper of
              the specified size: 10x14,  a3,  a4,  a5,  b4,  b5,
              executive,  folio,  legal,  letter,  note,  quarto,
              statement or tabloid.

       -s     Include  text  with  the  so-called  "hidden  text"
              attribute.

       -t     Output in text form. (default)

       -w width
              In  text mode this is the line width in characters.
              A value of zero puts an entire paragraph on a line,
              useful  when  the  text  is  to  used  as input for
              another wordprocessor. This  value  is  ignored  in
              PostScript mode.

       -x document type definition
              Output  in  XML  form.  Currently the only document
              type definition is db (for DocBook).

       -L     In PostScript mode: use landscape mode.

FILES
       Mapping files like 8859-1.txt
              Antiword looks  for  its  mapping  files  in  three
              directories, in the order given:
              (1) The directory specified by $ANTIWORDHOME
              (2) The directory specified by $HOME/.antiword
              (3) Directory /usr/share/antiword

       The fontnames file
              Antiword  will  look  for  its fontname file in the
              same directories as used for the mapping files.
              The fontnames file contains the  translation  table
              from  font names used by MS Word to font names used
              by PostScript.

       NOTE:
              Antiword cannot tell the difference between a  file
              that  does  not  exist  and  a  file that cannot be
              opened for reading.

ENVIRONMENT
       Antiword uses the environment variable ``ANTIWORDHOME'' as
       the  first  directory to look for its files. Antiword uses
       the environment variable ``HOME'' to find the user's  home
       directory.   When  in  text  mode  it  uses  the  variable
       ``COLUMNS'' to set the width of the output  (unless  over-
       ridden by the -w option).

BUGS
       Antiword  is  far  from  complete. Many features are still
       missing. Many images are not shown yet. Some of the images
       that  are shown, are shown in the wrong place.  PostScript
       output is only available in ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-2.
