Hi,

Steps to integrate antiword into NetScape 4.73 (should also work with earlier
versions).

Programs that launch from netscape must startup an X window to display their
output (otherwise output ends up it the bit bucket on your system).  I wrote the
following script to do this for antiword (and saved it as
"/usr/local/bin/xantiword":

#!/bin/csh -f
setenv FILE $1
setenv NEWFILE ${FILE}.xantiword
/usr/local/bin/antiword $FILE >&$NEWFILE
/usr/bin/X11/xterm -title "$FILE (MS Word)" -e /usr/bsd/more $NEWFILE
rm -f $NEWFILE

The above script works, but may not be the best way to do it.  If you come up
with a more elegant solution, then please let me know.

Next you'll have to tell netscape to execute the "/usr/local/bin/xantiword"
script when word documents are clicked on.  The easiest way to do this is to
change the /usr/local/lib/netscape/mailcap netscape configuration file.  For
SGI version of netscape the following two lines are changed.  For other versions
of netscape, one should find similar lines or will need to add the new lines.

Old lines (try to run SoftWindows, which is not installed on my system):

    application/x-dos_ms_word; /usr/local/lib/netscape/swinexec %s winword; \
        description="Microsoft Word-for-Windows Document";
    application/msword; /usr/local/lib/netscape/swinexec %s winword; \
        description="Microsoft Word-for-Windows Document";

New lines (for antiword execution), which replace old lines on my system:

    application/x-dos_ms_word; /usr/local/bin/xantiword %s; \
        description="Microsoft Word-for-Windows Document";
    application/msword; /usr/local/bin/xantiword %s; \
        description="Microsoft Word-for-Windows Document";

These changes can also be made via the netscape preferences, under
Navigator/Applications, but then the changes would only be for the user that
changed them.  The above change to the mailcap file affects all users, which is
what you'll usually want.

 Note that the above file paths may be different for your system.  On our linux
box, a quick search DID NOT show where the mailcap for netscape was stored, but
I did find one in /etc/mailcap.  I don't have time to experiment to see if this
is the same one that netscape uses.

If you have questions then please E-mail me.

Hi,

I just discovered a program called "xless".  It would actually be easier to use
than my previous xterm/more solution.  To use it change the
"/usr/local/bin/xantiword" script to: 

#!/bin/csh -f
setenv FILE $1
/usr/local/bin/antiword $FILE | /usr/freeware/bin/xless \
            -title "$FILE (MS Word)" -geometry 100x60

Note that one also needs to have xless installed.  It can be found on the
SGI Freeware Feb 1999 (or later) CD-ROM.

Hi!

Another way to integrate antiword into netscape is to copy the following
line in your .mailcap file :

application/msword; ns="%s"\; nf="${ns}".ps\; antiword -pa4 "${ns}" >
"${nf}"\; gv "${nf}"\; sleep 2 \; rm "${nf}"

In order to view the file into netscape you can write the xantiword file
like this:
 
#!/bin/csh -f
setenv FILE $1
setenv NEWFILE ${FILE}.xantiword
/usr/local/bin/antiword $FILE >&$NEWFILE
netscape -remote 'openFile('$NEWFILE')'

I include a script for netscape to see the document with ghostview.
 
#!/bin/csh -f
setenv FILE $1
setenv NEWFILE ${FILE}.xantiword
/usr/local/bin/antiword -pa4 $FILE >&$NEWFILE
/usr/X11R6/bin/gv $NEWFILE
rm -f $NEWFILE
 
In netscape the application must be called like that
"/usr/local/bin/xantiword %s"
 
This is just a small change(done by Roger Luechinger) to the xantiword
you included in the distribution 0.31
 
Thanks
