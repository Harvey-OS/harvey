realmode emulator. binds itself over /dev and provides /dev/realmode
and /dev/realmodemem to be used with aux/vga -m vesa ...

the command option -t enables instruction tracing to stderr.

requires a updated vgavesa driver to use /dev/realmode instead of
a direct realmode() call.

patch can be found at: /n/sources/patch/vesa-softscreen-resize

a list with graphics cards that have been successfully enabled
with the aux/vga and realemu can be found in the vgalist file.
