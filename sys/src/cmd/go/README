# Go commands for Harvey

## Quickstart

	./fetchrepos.rc
	mk all
	mk install


## Description

The `commands` file contains a list of repositories and the directories into which they should be checked out, e.g.:

	git://github.com/Harvey-OS/edwood.git edwood

In the Harvey distribution, these should already be fetched for you, but otherwise the fetchrepos.rc and fetchrepos.sh scripts exist to do the job.

Once repos are fetched, just run mk all / mk install as normal.
