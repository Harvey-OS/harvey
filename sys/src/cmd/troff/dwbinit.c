/*
 *
 * Pathname management routines for DWB C programs.
 *
 * Applications should initialize a dwbinit array with the string
 * pointers and arrays that need to be updated, and then hand that
 * array to DWBinit before much else happens in their main program.
 * DWBinit calls DWBhome to get the current home directory. DWBhome
 * uses the last definition of DWBENV (usually "DWBHOME") in file
 * DWBCONFIG (e.g., /usr/lib/dwb3.4) or the value assigned to that
 * variable in the environment if the DWBCONFIG file doesn't exist,
 * can't be read, or doesn't define DWBENV.
 *
 * DWBCONFIG must be a simple shell script - comments, a definition
 * of DWBHOME, and perhaps an export or echo is about all that's
 * allowed. The parsing in DWBhome is simple and makes no attempt
 * to duplicate the shell. It only looks for DWBHOME= as the first
 * non-white space string on a line, so
 *
 *	#
 *	# A sample DWBCONFIG shell script
 *	#
 *
 *	DWBHOME=/usr/add-on/dwb3.4
 *	export DWBHOME
 *
 * means DWBhome would return "/usr/add-on/dwb3.4" for the DWB home
 * directory. A DWBCONFIG file means there can only be one working
 * copy of a DWB release on a system, which seems like a good idea.
 * Using DWBCONFIG also means programs will always include correct
 * versions of files (e.g., prologues or macro packages).
 *
 * Relying on an environment variable guarantees nothing. You could
 * execute a version of dpost, but your environment might point at
 * incorrect font tables or prologues. Despite the obvious problems
 * we've also implemented an environment variable approach, but it's
 * only used if there's no DWBCONFIG file.
 *
 * DWBinit calls DWBhome to get the DWB home directory prefix and
 * then marches through its dwbinit argument, removing the default
 * home directory and prepending the new home. DWBinit stops when
 * it reaches an element that has NULL for its address and value
 * fields. Pointers in a dwbinit array are reallocated and properly
 * initialized; arrays are simply reinitialized if there's room.
 * All pathnames that are to be adjusted should be relative. For
 * example,
 *
 *	char	*fontdir = "lib/font";
 *	char	xyzzy[25] = "etc/xyzzy";
 *
 * would be represented in a dwbinit array as,
 *
 *	dwbinit allpaths[] = {
 *		&fontdir, NULL, 0,
 *		NULL, xyzzy, sizeof(xyzzy),
 *		NULL, NULL, 0
 *	};
 *
 * The last element must have NULL entries for the address and
 * value fields. The main() routine would then do,
 *
 *	#include "dwbinit.h"
 *
 *	main() {
 *
 *		DWBinit("program name", allpaths);
 *		...
 *	}
 *
 * Debugging is enabled if DWBDEBUG is in the environment and has
 * the value ON. Output is occasionally useful and probably should
 * be documented.
