here are some ideas w.r.t. panning in proof:

1. if you pan down, currently you stay at the same position in the
next page; meaning you have to pan back up if you don't shrink the
page...

2. using the "view" key on a gnot as a scroll down key would match
the gnot window view

3. it might be nice to have to borders in grey so one has an idea of
page layout ...

just some small ideas...
