/*
 * acpidump - A portable utility for obtaining system ACPI tables and dumping
 * them in an ASCII hex format suitable for binary extraction via acpixtract.
 *
 * Obtaining the system ACPI tables is an OS-specific operation.
 *
 * This utility can be ported to any host operating system by providing a
 * module containing system-specific versions of these interfaces:
 *
 *      AcpiOsGetTableByAddress
 *      AcpiOsGetTableByIndex
 *      AcpiOsGetTableByName
 *
 * See the ACPICA Reference Guide for the exact definitions of these
 * interfaces. Also, see these ACPICA source code modules for example
 * implementations:
 *
 *      source/os_specific/service_layers/oswintbl.c
 *      source/os_specific/service_layers/oslinuxtbl.c
