This file, psfiles.doc, describes the .ps files distributed with
Ghostscript, other than fonts.

For an overview of Ghostscript and a list of the documentation files, see
README.

System files
------------

gs_init.ps - Ghostscript reads this automatically when it starts up.  It
contains definitions of many standard procedures and initialization for a
wide variety of things.

gs_btokn.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the btoken feature is included in
the configuration.  It provides support for binary tokens.

gs_ccfnt.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the ccfonts feature is included
in the configuration.  It provides support for compiled fonts.

gs_cmdl.ps - This file is not used yet.  Eventually it will replace C code
that parses the Ghostscript command line.

gs_fonts.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in.  It initializes Ghostscript's font
machinery and provides some utility procedures that work with fonts.

gs_kanji.ps - This file provides support for the Wadalab free Kanji font.

gs_pfile.ps - This file provides runtime support for packed fonts.

gs_statd.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in.  It creates a dummy statusdict and
some other environmental odds and ends for the benefit of PostScript files
that really want to be printed on a LaserWriter.

gs_dps1.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the dps feature is included in
the configuration.  It provides support for various Display PostScript and
Level 2 features.

gs_lev2.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the Ghostscript interpreter
includes Level 2 PostScript functions.  It contains definitions of
procedures and miscellaneous initialization for the Level 2 functions.

gs_res.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the Level 2 resource machinery is
included.  Currently, this is the case for all Level 2 configurations.

gs_type0.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the Ghostscript interpreter
includes composite (Type 0) font capability.

gs_type1.ps - gs_init.ps reads this in if the Ghostscript interpreter
includes Type 1 font capability (which it normally does).

gs_*_e.ps - These files define the Encodings known to Ghostscript.  All of
them except gs_std_e.ps and gs_iso_e.ps are loaded only if referenced.

Art
---

chess.ps - A black-and-white chessboard.

golfer.ps - A gray-scale picture of a stylishly dressed woman swinging a
golf club.

escher.ps - A colored version of a hexagonally symmetric Escher drawing of
interlocking butterflies.  Can be printed on monochrome devices, with
somewhat less dramatic results.

cheq.ps - A chessboard "font" used by chess.ps (obtained from the Adobe
file server).

snowflak.ps - A rectangular grid of intricate colored snowflakes.
(Renders very slowly.)

colorcir.ps - A set of nested ellipses made up of colored bars.

tiger.ps - A dramatic colored picture of a tiger's head.

Utilities
---------

For more information on these utility programs, see the comments at the
beginning of the files.  The ones marked with * have batch files or shell
scripts of the same name (e.g., bdftops, bdftops.bat) to invoke them
conveniently.

bench.ps - a file useful for running benchmarks.

* bdftops.ps - a utility for converting BDF fonts to outline form: see
fonts.doc for more information.

* gslp.ps - a utility for doing "line printing" of plain text files.

impath.ps - a utility for reconstructing outlines from bitmap images,
used by bdftops.

landscap.ps - a file that you can put in front of your own files to get
them rendered in landscape mode.

level1.ps - a file that turns off any Level 2 features.

packfile.ps - a utility for compressing fonts into a single file.

prfont.ps - a utility to print a font catalog.

* ps2ascii.ps - a utility for extracting the ASCII text from PostScript
source files.  It redefines many operators.  For more information, see the
comments in the file.

ps2ai.ps - a utility for converting an arbitrary PostScript file into a
form compatible with Adobe Illustrator.

* ps2epsi.ps - a utility for converting an arbitrary PostScript file into
EPSI form.

* pstoppm.ps - a utility for rendering PostScript files onto PPM (bitmap)
files.

quit.ps - a file containing just the word "quit".  (The -c switch now makes
this unnecessary; this file exists for backward compatibility.)

showpage.ps - a file containing just the word "showpage".  (The -c switch
now makes this unnecessary; this file exists for backward compatibility.)

viewgif.ps - a utility for displaying GIF files.

waterfal.ps - a utility to print a "waterfall" of fonts at different
sizes.

Development tools
-----------------

decrypt.ps - a utility for decrypting the eexec section of a font.

markpath.ps - a utility for showing the points on a path.

mergeini.ps - a utility for merging all the initialization files into
a single file.

pcharstr.ps - a utility for printing out the CharStrings and Subrs in a
Type 1 font.

ppath.ps - a couple of utilities for printing out the current path, for
debugging.

traceop.ps - a utility for tracing uses of any procedure or operator
for debugging.

type1enc.ps - the Type 1 font format encryption and decryption
algorithms written in PostScript.

unprot.ps - a prologue to disable access checking.

winmaps.ps - a utility for creating mappings between the Adobe encodings
and the Microsoft Windows character sets.

wrfont.ps - a utility for writing out an unprotected Type 1 font, such as
the standard Ghostscript fonts.

Odds and ends
-------------

lines.ps - a test program for line joins and caps.

type1ops.ps - the Type 1 font format opcodes.
