/*
 * The 3 principal Ghostscript stacks (operand, execution, and dictionary)
 * are implemented as a linked list of blocks.  On segmented MS-DOS and
 * MS Windows systems, where there is a substantial performance advantage
 * to keeping the top of the stack in the primary data segment, the top
 * block is stored there, and copied to and from blocks in the heap;
 * on systems with flat address spaces, the top block is stored in the heap
 * like other blocks.  Note that in environments with multiple PostScript
 * contexts, the MS-DOS approach requires some combination of keeping
 * multiple top blocks in the primary data segment, and copying top blocks
 * to and from the heap when switching contexts.
 *
 * Since all operators exit cleanly in case of stack under- or overflow,
 * we handle all issues related to stack blocks in the top-level error
 * recovery code in interp.c.  A few situations require special treatment:
 * see ostack.h, estack.h, and dstack.h for details.

 * Define the structure for a stack block.

 * t_array objects, with the first few elements used for special purposes.
 * The actual layout is as follows:
 *		ref_stack_block structure
 *		bottom guard if any (see below)
 *		used elements of block
 *		unused elements of block
 *		top guard if any (see below)
 * The `next' member of the next higher stack block includes all of this.
 * The `used' member only includes the used elements of this block.
 * Notes:
 *	- In the top block, the size of the `used' member may not be correct.
 *	- In all blocks but the top, we fill the unused elements with nulls.

 * In order to detect under- and overflow with minimum overhead, we may put
 * guard elements at the top and bottom of the stacks (see dstack.h,
 * estack.h, and ostack.h for details of the individual stacks).
 * On segmented systems, we only put guard elements around the top block;
 * on other systems, we put guard elements around every block.  Note that
 * in the latter case, the 'current' and  'next' arrays include the
 * guard elements.
 */

/*
 * The garbage collector requires that the entire contents of every block
 * be 'clean', i.e., contain legitimate refs; we also need to ensure that
 * at GC time, pointers in unused areas of a block will not be followed
 * (since they may be dangling).  We ensure this as follows:
 *	- When allocating a new block, we set the entire body to nulls.
 *	This is necessary because the block may be freed before the next GC,
 *	and the GC must be able to scan (parse) refs even if they are free.
 *	- When adding a new block to the top of the stack, we set to nulls
 *	the unused area of the new next-to-top blocks.
 *	- At the beginning of garbage collection, we set to nulls the unused
 *	elements of the top block.
