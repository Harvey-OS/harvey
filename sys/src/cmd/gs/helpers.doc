Major contributors
------------------

Special thanks are due to Russell Lang, for the GSview for Windows program
and for contributing most of the code for the Microsoft Windows and OS/2
environments; to Tim Theisen, for the Ghostview program for X Windows and
for major contributions to the development and support of code for the X
Windows environment; and to the Independent JPEG Group, for creating the
JPEG DCT library that Ghostscript uses.
