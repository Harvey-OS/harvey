.TH ps2epsi 1 "March 8, 1994"
.SH NAME
ps2epsi \- generate conforming postscript

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ps2epsi 
.I infile.ps
[
.I outfile.ps
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ps2epsi 
is a utility, based on
.I Ghostscript,
which takes as input a postscript 
file and generates a new output file which conforms to Adobe's
.I Encapsulated  Postscript Interchange
or EPSI format.  This is a
special form of encapsulated  postscript (EPS) which adds a bitmap
version of the final displayed page (in  the form of postscript
comments) to the beginning of the file. This bitmap  can be used by
programs which understand EPSI (usually word processors or  DTP
programs) to give a preview version of the postscript on screen. The
displayed quality is often not very good (eg. low resolution, no
colours),  but the final printed version uses the real postscript,
and thus has the normal postscript quality. 

.SH OPTIONS
None.

.SH UNIX USAGE
Using the supplied shell script, the command is:
.br
	ps2epsi
.I infile.ps
[ 
.I outfile.epsi
]
.br
where
.I infile.ps
is the input file and
.I outfile.epsi
is the output EPSI file. If the output filename is omitted, it will
be generated from the input filename.
If a standard extension (.ps, .cps, .eps or .epsf) is 
used, it will be replaced with the output extension .epsi.

.SH MSDOS USAGE
Using the supplied batch file, the command is simply:
.br
	ps2epsi
.I infile.ps outfile.epi
.br
where
.I infile.ps
is the original postscript file, and
.I outfile.epi
is the name of the output file.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Successful encapsulation of arbitrary postscript files cannot be
guaranteed, as there are certain restrictions in what is permitted in
a postscript file for it to be properly encapsulated.
.B ps2epsi
does a little extra work to try to help encapsulation, and it automatically
calculates the bounding box (required for all encapsulated postscript
files), so, most of the time, it does a pretty good job. There are
bound to be cases, however, where the encapsulation will not work,
because of the content of the original postscript file.

.SH FRAMEMAKER
The
.I Framemaker
DTP system is one application which understands EPSI
files, and
.B ps2epsi
has been tested on a number of postscript diagrams
from a variety of sources, using Framemaker 3.0 on a Sun.
.I Framemaker
on other platforms should be able to use these files,
although I have not been able to test this.

.SH FILES
