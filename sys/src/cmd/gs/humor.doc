Regarding Ghostscript: I hate to say this to you but I've already
implemented a Ghostscript interpreter. I'm happy to see that someone else
has recognized the need dead people have for computers. I have included an
example of the output of my Ghostscript at the end of this letter.

The interpreter is written in a language called cant-C, developed by Mr.
Turing last year. The compiler is easily ported to any environment you
care to name. I would be more than happy to send you a copy, but you must
first contact my lawyer for this venture, Thomas Jefferson of Phila. Pa..
(As a side note, Mr. Jefferson is very excited by Ghostscript. Look for
The Declaration of Independance V1.1 RSN).

The possibilities for Ghostscript go far beyond Deathtop publishing, I'm
sure you'll agree. I have contacted numerous authors who may be interested
in using Ghostscript (Shakespeare, Hemingway, etc) and all have been very
excited by what they've seen. (Shakespeare wants to write a modern Romeo
and Juliette, called Romeo and Julio, the story of 2 gay hispanic men kept
apart by their parents.) 

Anyway, here is the Ghostscript example I promised. Feel free to show this
to your friends and colleagues, I'm sure they'll all be suitably impressed.
