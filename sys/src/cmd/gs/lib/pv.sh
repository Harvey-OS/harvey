# The following line used to appear here:

#RESOLUTION=100

# But according to Peter Dyballa
# <pete@lovelace.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de>, "Modern versions of dvips are
# taught to read configuration files which tell them the paths to PK, TFM,
# VF and other files for example PostScript font programmes. These files
# tell #dvips too which default resolution is used and therefore which
# series of PK files (based on 300 DPI or 400 DPI or 600 DPI or even more)
# are held on the system."  So we have deleted this line, and also removed
# the -D switch from the call of dvips below.
