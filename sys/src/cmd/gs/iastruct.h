/* ================ Objects ================ */

/*
 * Object headers come in a number of different varieties.
 * All arise from the same basic form, which is
	-l- -lmsize/mark/back-
	-size-
	-type/reloc-
 * l (large) is a single bit.  The size of lmsize/mark/back, size, and type
 * varies according to the environment.  On machines with N:16 segmented
 * addressing, 16-bit ints, and no alignment requirement more severe than
 * 2 bytes, we can squeeze an object header into 6 bytes by making these
 * fields 16 bits (using _ds addressing).  On all other machines, we let the
 * lmsize/mark/back field be 1 bit shorter than a uint, and round the header
 * size up to the next multiple of the most severe alignment restriction
 * (4 or 8 bytes).  Miraculously, we can do all this without any case testing.
 *
 * The mark/back field is used for the mark during the marking phase of
 * garbage collection, and for a back pointer value during the compaction
 * phase.  Since we want to be able to collect local VM independently of
 * global VM, we need two different distinguished mark values:
 *	- For local objects that have not been traced and should be freed
 *	(compacted out), we use 1...11 in the mark field (o_unmarked).
 *	- For global objects that have not been traced but should be kept,
 *	we use 1...10 in the mark field (o_untraced).
 * Note that neither of these values is a possible real relocation value.
 *
 * The lmsize field of large objects overlaps mark and back, so we must
 * handle these functions for large objects in some other way.
 * Since large objects cannot be moved or relocated, we don't need the
 * back field for them; we allocate 2 bits for the 3 mark values.
 */
/*
 * The back pointer's meaning depends on whether the object is
 * free (unmarked) or in use (marked):
 *	- In free objects, the back pointer is an offset from the object
 * header back to a chunk_head_t structure that contains the location
 * to which all the data in this chunk will get moved; the reloc field
 * contains the amount by which the following run of useful objects
 * will be relocated downwards.
 *	- In useful objects, the back pointer is an offset from the object
 * back to the previous free object; the reloc field is not used (it
 * overlays the type field).
 * These two cases can be distinguished when scanning a chunk linearly,
 * but when simply examining an object via a pointer, the chunk pointer
 * is also needed.
