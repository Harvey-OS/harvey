/*
 * The execution stack holds several different kinds of objects (refs)
 * related to executing PostScript code:
 *
 *      - Procedures being executed are held here.  They always have
 * type = t_array, t_mixedarray, or t_shortarray, with a_executable set.
 * More specifically, the e-stack holds the as yet unexecuted tail of the
 * procedure.
 *
 *      - if, ifelse, etc. push arguments to be executed here.  They may be
 * any kind of object whatever.  Similarly, looping operators (forall, for,
 * etc.) push the procedure that is to be executed for each iteration.
 *
 *      - Control operators (filenameforall, for, repeat, loop, forall,
 * pathforall, run, stopped, ...) use continuations as described below.
 *
 * Note that there are many internal operators that need to use
 * continuations -- for example, all the 'show' operators, since they may
 * call out to BuildChar procedures.
 */

/*
 * Because the Ghostscript architecture doesn't allow recursive calls to the
 * interpreter, any operator that needs to call out to PostScript code (for
 * example, the 'show' operators calling a BuildChar procedure, or setscreen
 * sampling a spot function) must use a continuation -- an internal
 * "operator" procedure that continues the logical thread of execution after
 * the callout.  Operators needing to use continuations push the following
 * onto the execution stack (from bottom to top):
 *
 *	- An e-stack mark -- an executable null that indicates the bottom of
 *	the block associated with a callout.  (This should not be confused
 *	with a PostScript mark, a ref of type t_mark on the operand stack.)
 *	See make_mark_estack and push_mark_estack below.  The value.opproc
 *	member of the e-stack mark contains a procedure to execute in case
 *	the e-stack is stripped back beyond this point by a 'stop' or
 *	'exit': see pop_estack in zcontrol.c for details.
 *
 *	- Any number of refs holding information that the continuation
 *	operator needs -- i.e., the saved logical state of the thread of
 *	execution.  For example, 'for' stores the procedure, the current
 *	value, the increment, and the limit here.
 *
 *	- The continuation procedure itself -- the pseudo-operator to be
 *	called after returns from the interpreter callout.  See
 *	make_op_estack and push_op_estack below.
 *
 *	- The PostScript procedure for the interpreter to execute.
 *
 * The operator then returns o_push_estack, indicating to the interpreter
 * that the operator has pushed information on the e-stack for the
 * interpreter to process.
 *
 * When the interpreter finishes executing the PostScript procedure, it pops
 * the next item off the e-stack, which is the continuation procedure.  When
 * the continuation procedure gets control, the top of the e-stack (esp)
 * points just below the continuation procedure slot -- i.e., to the topmost
 * saved state item.  The continuation procedure normally pops all of the
 * saved state, and the e-stack mark, and continues execution normally,
 * eventually returning o_pop_estack to tell the interpreter that the
 * "operator" has popped information off the e-stack.  (Loop operators do
 * something a bit more efficient than popping the information and then
 * pushing it again: refer to the examples in zcontrol.c for details.)
 *
 * Continuation procedures are called just like any other operator, so they
 * can call each other, or be called from ordinary operator procedures, as
 * long as the e-stack is in the right state.  The most complex example of
 * this is probably the Type 1 character rendering code in zchar1.c, where
 * continuation procedures either call each other directly or call out to
 * the interpreter to execute optional PostScript procedures like CDevProc.

 * The execution stack is implemented as a linked list of blocks;
 * operators that can push or pop an unbounded number of values, or that
 * access the entire e-stack, must take this into account.  These are:
 *      exit  .stop  .instopped  countexecstack  execstack  currentfile
 *      .execn
 *      pop_estack(exit, stop, error recovery)
 *      gs_show_find(all the show operators)
 * In addition, for e-stack entries created by control operators, we must
 * ensure that the mark and its data are never separated.  We do this
 * by ensuring that when splitting the top block, at least N items
 * are kept in the new top block above the bottommost retained mark,
 * where N is the largest number of data items associated with a mark.
 * Finally, in order to avoid specific checks for underflowing a block,
 * we put a guard entry at the bottom of each block except the top one
 * that contains a procedure that returns an internal "exec stack block
 * underflow" error.
