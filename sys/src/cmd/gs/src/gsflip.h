 * Convert planar (MultipleDataSource) input to chunky format.  The input
 * data starts at planes[0] + offset ... planes[num_planes-1] + offset; the
 * output is stored at buffer.  This procedure assumes that the input
 * consists of an integral number of pixels; in particular, for 12-bit
 * input, nbytes is rounded up to a multiple of 3.  num_planes must be >=0;
 * bits_per_sample must be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 12.  Returns -1 if num_planes or
 * bits_per_sample is invalid, otherwise 0.
