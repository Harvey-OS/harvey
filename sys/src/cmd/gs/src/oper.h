 * Operator procedures take a single argument.  This is currently a pointer
 * to the current context state, but might conceivably change in the future.
 * They return 0 for success, a negative code for an error, or a positive
 * code for some uncommon situations (see below).
 */

/*
 * In order to combine typecheck and stackunderflow error checking
 * into a single test, we guard the bottom of the o-stack with
 * additional entries of type t__invalid.  However, if a type check fails,
 * we must make an additional check to determine which error
 * should be reported.  In order not to have to make this check in-line
 * in every type check in every operator, we define a procedure that takes
 * an o-stack pointer and returns e_stackunderflow if it points to
 * a guard entry, e_typecheck otherwise.
 *
 * Note that we only need to do this for typecheck, not for any other
 * kind of error such as invalidaccess, since any operator that can
 * generate the latter will do a check_type or a check_op first.
 * (See ostack.h for more information.)
 *
 * We define the operand type of check_type_failed as const ref * rather than
 * const_os_ptr simply because there are a number of routines that might
 * be used either with a stack operand or with a general operand, and
 * the check for t__invalid is harmless when applied to off-stack refs.

 * If an operator has popped or pushed something on the control stack,

 * It is OK to return o_pop_estack if nothing has been popped,
 * but it is not OK to return o_push_estack if nothing has been pushed.
 *
 * If an operator has suspended the current context and wants the
 * interpreter to call the scheduler, it must return o_reschedule.
 * It may also have pushed or popped elements on the control stack.
 * (This is only used when the Display PostScript option is included.)
 *
 * These values must be greater than 1, and far enough apart from zero and
 * from each other not to tempt a compiler into implementing a 'switch'
 * on them using indexing rather than testing.
