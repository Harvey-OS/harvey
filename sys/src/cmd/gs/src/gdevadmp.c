 * Apple DMP / Imagewriter driver
 *
 * This is a modification of Mark Wedel's Apple DMP and 
 * Jonathan Luckey's Imagewriter II driver to
 * support the Imagewriter LQ's higher resolution (320x216):
 *      appledmp:  120dpi x  72dpi is still supported (yuck)
 *	iwlo:	   160dpi x  72dpi
 *	iwhi:	   160dpi x 144dpi
 *      iwlq:      320dpi x 216dpi
 *
 * This is also my first attempt to work with gs. I have not included the LQ's
 * ability to print in colour. Perhaps at a later date I will tackle that.
 *
 * BTW, to get your Imagewriter LQ serial printer to work with a PC, attach it
 * with a nullmodem serial cable.

 * This is a modification of Mark Wedel's Apple DMP driver to

 *	iwhi:	   160dpi x 144dpi
 *
 * The Imagewriter II is a bit odd.  In pinfeed mode, it thinks its
 * First line is 1 inch from the top of the page. If you set the top
 * form so that it starts printing at the top of the page, and print
 * to near the bottom, it thinks it has run onto the next page and
 * the formfeed will skip a whole page.  As a work around, I reverse
 * the paper about a 1.5 inches at the end of the page before the
 * formfeed to make it think its on the 'right' page.  bah. hack!
 * 
 * This is  my first attempt to work with gs, so your milage may vary

/* This is a bare bones driver I developed for my apple Dot Matrix Printer.
 * This code originally was from the epson driver, but I removed a lot
 * of stuff that was not needed.
 *
 * The Dot Matrix Printer was a predecessor to the apple Imagewriter.  Its
 * main difference being that it was parallel.
 *
 * This code should work fine on Imagewriters, as they have a superset
 * of commands compared to the DMP printer.
 *
 * This driver does not produce the smalles output files possible.  To
 * do that, it should look through the output strings and find repeat
 * occurances of characters, and use the escape sequence that allows
 * printing repeat sequences.  However, as I see it, this the limiting
 * factor in printing is not transmission speed to the printer itself,
 * but rather, how fast the print head can move.  This is assuming the
 * printer is set up with a reasonable speed (9600 bps)
 *
 * WHAT THE CODE DOES AND DOES NOT DO:
 *
 * To print out images, it sets the printer for unidirection printing
 * and 15 cpi (120 dpi). IT sets line feed to 1/9 of an inch (72 dpi).
 * When finished, it sets things back to bidirection print, 1/8" line
 * feeds, and 12 cpi.  There does not appear to be a way to reset
 * things to initial values.
 *
 * This code does not set for 8 bit characters (which is required). It
 * also assumes that carriage return/newline is needed, and not just
 * carriage return.  These are all switch settings on the DMP, and
 * I have configured them for 8 bit data and cr only.
 *
 * You can search for the strings Init and Reset to find the strings
 * that set up the printer and clear things when finished, and change
 * them to meet your needs.
 *
 * Also, you need to make sure that the printer daemon (assuming unix)
 * doesn't change the data as it is being printed.  I have set my
 * printcap file (sunos 4.1.1) with the string:
 * ms=pass8,-opost
 * and it works fine.
 *
 * Feel free to improve this code if you want.  However, please make
 * sure that the old DMP will still be supported by any changes.  This
 * may mean making an imagewriter device, and just copying this file
 * to something like gdevimage.c.
 *
 * The limiting factor of the DMP is the vertical resolution.  However, I
 * see no way to do anything about this.  Horizontal resolution could
 * be increased by using 17 cpi (136 dpi).  I believe the Imagewriter
 * supports 24 cpi (192 dpi).  However, the higher dpi, the slower
 * the printing.
