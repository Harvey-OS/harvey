/* %rom% IODevice implementation for a compressed in-memory filesystem */

/*
 * This file implements a special %rom% IODevice designed for embedded
 * use. It accesses a compressed filesytem image which may be stored
 * in literal ROM, or more commonly is just static data linked directly
 * into the executable. This can be used for storing postscript library
 * files, fonts, Resources or other data files that Ghostscript needs
 * to run.
