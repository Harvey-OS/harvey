/* I don't know the whole protocol for the printer, but let me tell
 * you about the fraction I use.
 * Each page begins with a header, which I describe as init1, init2, init3 --
 *  (I separate them, because I've seen output in which those sections
 *   seemed to appear independently, but I've deleted the only code I
 *   had that actually used them separately.)
 * Then there are a number of swipe commands, each of which describes one
 * swipe of the printhead.  Each swipe command begins with a fixed
 * header, which gives the number of bytes in the command,
 * left and right margins,
 * a vertical offset, some noise characters I don't know the meaning of,
 * and the table of bits.  The bits are given one column at a time, using a
 * simple compression scheme: a directory, consisting of two bytes, tells
 * which sixteen-bit intervals of the 208-bit column contain 1-bits; then
 * the appropriate number of sixteen-bit bit-maps follow.  (A zero-bit in the
 * directory indicates that a bitmap for that sector follows.) In the worst case,
 * this scheme would be bigger than the uncompressed bitmap, but it seems to
 * usually save 80-90%.  The biggest complication of the bitmap scheme is this:
 * There are two print-heads on the black cartridge, and they are 16 pixels
 * (or headSeparation) apart.  Odd columns of the swipe address one printhead,
 * and even columns the other.  On the following swipe, the printheads
 * addressed by even and odd columns are reversed.  I think the printheads might be
 * staggered, but the output I've seen staggers things in software;
 * adjacent vertical bits on the same head are not addressed; the missing
 * bits are written in by the second head when it passes (16 columns later.)
 * In my code, I call the state of addressing one head or the other "direction".
 * Originally I thought that the printhead was writing on both leftward and
 * rightward motion, and that which head was addressed by odd columns changed
 * accordingly.  I'm no longer sure this is true, but the head addressed by the
 * even columns does alternate with each swipe.
