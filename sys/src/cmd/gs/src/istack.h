/*
 * The 3 principal Ghostscript stacks (operand, execution, and dictionary)
 * are implemented as a linked list of blocks.
 *
 * Since all operators exit cleanly in case of stack under- or overflow,
 * we handle all issues related to stack blocks in the top-level error
 * recovery code in interp.c.  A few situations require special treatment:
 * see ostack.h, estack.h, and dstack.h for details.
 */

/*
 * Define the structure for a stack block.
 * In order to simplify allocation, stack blocks are implemented as
 * t_array objects, with the first few elements used for special purposes.
 * The actual layout is as follows:
 *              ref_stack_block structure
 *              bottom guard if any (see below)
 *              used elements of block
 *              unused elements of block
 *              top guard if any (see below)
 * The `next' member of the next higher stack block includes all of this.
 * The `used' member only includes the used elements of this block.
 * Notes:
 *      - In the top block, the size of the `used' member may not be correct.
 *      - In all blocks but the top, we fill the unused elements with nulls.
