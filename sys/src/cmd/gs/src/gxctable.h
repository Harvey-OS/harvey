 * Define a 3- or 4-D color lookup table.
 * n is the number of dimensions (input indices), 3 or 4.
 * dims[0..n-1] are the table dimensions.
 * m is the number of output values, typically 3 (RGB) or 4 (CMYK).
 * For n = 3:
 *   table[i], 0 <= i < dims[0], point to strings of length
 *     dims[1] x dims[2] x m.
 * For n = 4:
 *   table[i], 0 <= i < dims[0] x dims[1], points to strings of length
 *     dims[2] x dims[3] x m.
 * It isn't really necessary to store the size of each string, since
 * they're all the same size, but it makes things a lot easier for the GC.
