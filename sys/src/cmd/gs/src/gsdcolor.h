/*
 * The device color in the graphics state is computed from client color
 * specifications, and kept current through changes in transfer function,
 * device, and (if relevant) halftone phase.
 * (gx_set_dev_color sets the device color if needed.)
 * For binary halftones (and eventually colored halftones as well),
 * the bitmaps are only cached, so internal clients (the painting operators)
 * must call gx_color_load to ensure that the bitmap is available.
 * Device color elements set by gx_color_load are marked with @ below.
 *
 * Base colors are represented as follows:
 *
 *      Pure color (gx_dc_pure):
 *              colors.pure = the color;
 *      Binary halftone (gx_dc_ht_binary):
 *              colors.binary.b_ht = the device halftone;
 *		colors.binary.b_index = -1 if b_ht is the halftone,
 *		  otherwise an index in b_ht.components
 *              colors.binary.color[0] = the color for 0s (darker);
 *              colors.binary.color[1] = the color for 1s (lighter);
 *              colors.binary.b_level = the number of pixels to lighten,
 *                0 < halftone_level < P, the number of pixels in the tile;
 *      @       colors.binary.b_tile points to an entry in the binary
 *                tile cache.
 *      Colored halftone (gx_dc_ht_colored):
 *              colors.colored.c_ht = the device halftone;
 *              colors.colored.c_level[0..N-1] = the halftone levels,
 *                like b_level;
 *              colors.colored.c_base[0..N-1] = the base colors;
 *                N = the device color_info.num_components
 *		    (3 for RGB devices, 4 for CMYK devices, ? for DeviceN);
 *                0 <= c_level[i] < P;
 *                0 <= c_base[i] <= dither_rgb;
 *              colors.colored.alpha = the opacity.
 *		colors.colored.plane_mask: bit 2^i = 1 iff c_level[i] != 0
 *      Colored PatternType 1 pattern (gx_dc_pattern):
 *              (mask is also set, see below)
 *      @       colors.pattern.p_tile points to a gx_color_tile in
 *                the pattern cache, or is NULL for a null pattern.
 *
 * The phase element is used for all colors except pure ones.  It holds the
 * negative of the graphics state halftone phase, modulo the halftone tile
 * size.
 *
 * The ccolor element is used for all kinds of patterns.  It is needed for
 * rendering the pattern.
 *
 * The mask elements of a device color are only used for PatternType 1
 * patterns:
 *      Non-pattern:
 *              mask is unused.
 *      Pattern:
 *              mask.id gives the ID of the pattern (and its mask);
 *              mask.m_phase holds the negative of the graphics state
 *                halftone phase;
 *      @       mask.m_tile points to a gx_color_tile in the pattern cache,
 *                or is NULL for a pattern that doesn't require a mask.
 *                (The 'bits' of the tile are not accessed.)
 *                For colored patterns requiring a mask, p_tile and
 *                mask.m_tile point to the same cache entry.
 * For masked colors, gx_set_dev_color replaces the type with a different
 * type that applies the mask when painting.  These types are not defined
 * here, because they are only used in Level 2.

/*
 * For the command list, it is useful to record the most recent device
 * color placed in a band, so as to avoid sending unnecessary
 * information. The following structure is used for that purpose. It is
 * created by the save_dc method, and can be utilized by the write
 * method. It should otherwise be considered opaque, though it is
 * guarranteed not to contain pointers to allocated memory (and thus does
 * not interact with the GC code for containing structures).
 *
 * The reason a structure distinct from the device color itself is used
 * for this purpose is related to an anomally involving reference to
 * device halftones. The gx_device_halftone structure is reference
 * counted, but a long standing (and not easily removable) convention
 * in the code states that only reference from imager (graphic) states
 * to halftones are counted; reference from device colors are not. The
 * pointer to a halftone in a saved device color may, therefore,
 * become a dangling pointer. This does not occur in other uses of a
 * device color, because a color can only be usable when the hafltone
 * it references is the current halftone in some imager state.
 *
 * Because halftones are large and seldom changed, they are always sent
 * as "all bands" commands. Individual device colors, by contrast, are
 * usually written just for the bands that make use of them. The
 * distinction between these two cases can only be handled by command
 * list writer code itself, so this structure does not involve the
 * halftone. If the halftone changes, however, the write method should
 * be passed a null pointer for the saved color operand; this will
 * ensure the the full device color information is written.
 *
 * Currently patterns cannot be passed through the command list,
 * however vector devices need to save a color for comparing
 * it with another color, which appears later.
 * We provide a minimal support, which is necessary
 * for the current implementation of pdfwrite.
 * It is not sufficient for restoring the pattern from the saved color.
