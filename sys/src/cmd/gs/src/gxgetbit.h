 * gx_bitmap_format_t defines the options passed to get_bits_rectangle,
 * which indicate which formats are acceptable for the returned data.  If
 * successful, get_bits_rectangle sets the options member of the parameter
 * record to indicate what options were chosen -- 1 per group, and never the
 * _ANY option.  Note that the chosen option is not necessarily one that
 * appeared in the original options: for example, if GB_RASTER_ANY is the
 * only raster option originally set, the chosen option will be
 * GB_RASTER_STANDARD or GB_RASTER_SPECIFIED.
 *
 * If the options mask is 0, get_bits_rectangle must set it to the
 * complete set of supported options and return an error.  This allows
 * clients to determine what options are supported without actually doing
 * a transfer.
 *
 * All devices must support at least one option in each group, and must
 * support GB_COLORS_NATIVE.
 *
 * NOTE: the current default implementation supports only the following
 * options in their respective groups (i.e., any other options must be
 * supported directly by the device):
 *      GB_DEPTH_8
 *      GB_PACKING_CHUNKY
 *      GB_RETURN_COPY
 * The current default implementation also requires that all devices
 * support GB_PACKING_CHUNKY.  */
