# Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always

# and confusion problems, but users insist on it.
# NOTE: this also affects searching for files named on the command line:

# Because of this, setting SEARCH_HERE_FIRST to 0 is not recommended.

# Choose generic configuration options.

# -DDEBUG
#	includes debugging features (-Z switch) in the code.

#	  are set.
# -DNOPRIVATE
#	makes private (static) procedures and variables public,

#	  No execution time or space penalty.

# Define the name of the executable file.

GS=gs

# Define the name of a pre-built executable that can be invoked at build

#   - the standard name of Ghostscript on your system (typically `gs'):

# DON'T DO THIS. If you do, the resulting executable will not be able to
# read some PostScript files containing JPEG data, because Adobe chose to
# define PostScript's JPEG capabilities in a way that is slightly
# incompatible with the JPEG standard.  Note also that if you set SHARE_JPEG

#	-DBSD4_2 for 4.2bsd systems.
#	-DSYSV for System V or DG/UX.
#	-DSVR4 -DSVR4_0 (not -DSYSV) for System V release 4.0.

#	-R /usr/local/xxx/lib:/usr/local/lib

# Apollos running DomainOS don't support -X (and -x has no effect).
# XLDFLAGS can be set from the command line.

# Solaris may need -lnsl -lsocket -lposix4.
# (Libraries required by individual drivers are handled automatically.)

EXTRALIBS=

# Define the standard libraries to search at the end of linking.
# Most platforms require -lpthread for the POSIX threads library;
# on FreeBSD, change -lpthread to -lc_r; BSDI and perhaps some others
# include pthreads in libc and don't require any additional library.
# All reasonable platforms require -lm, but Rhapsody and perhaps one or
# two others fold libm into libc and don't require any additional library.

#STDLIBS=-lpthread -lm

# Since the default build is for nosync, don't include pthread lib

# Define the include switch(es) for the X11 header files.
# This can be null if handled in some other way (e.g., the files are
# in /usr/include, or the directory is supplied by an environment variable);
# in particular, SCO Xenix, Unix, and ODT just want

# Note that x_.h expects to find the header files in $(XINCLUDE)/X11,
# not in $(XINCLUDE).

XINCLUDE=-I/usr/X11R6/include

# Define the directory/ies and library names for the X11 library files.
# XLIBDIRS is for ld and should include -L; XLIBDIR is for LD_RUN_PATH
# (dynamic libraries on SVR4) and should not include -L.
# Newer SVR4 systems can use -R in XLIBDIRS rather than setting XLIBDIR.
# Both can be null if these files are in the default linker search path;
# in particular, SCO Xenix, Unix, and ODT just want
#XLIBDIRS=
# Solaris and other SVR4 systems with dynamic linking probably want

# Define whether this platform has floating point hardware:
#	FPU_TYPE=2 means floating point is faster than fixed point.
# (This is the case on some RISCs with multiple instruction dispatch.)
#	FPU_TYPE=1 means floating point is at worst only slightly slower
# than fixed point.
#	FPU_TYPE=0 means that floating point may be considerably slower.
#	FPU_TYPE=-1 means that floating point is always much slower than
# fixed point.

FPU_TYPE=1

# Define the .dev module that implements thread and synchronization
# primitives for this platform.  Don't change this unless you really know
# what you're doing.

# the pthread library.

BAND_LIST_STORAGE=file

# Choose which compression method to use when storing band lists in memory.
# The choices are 'lzw' or 'zlib'.  lzw is not recommended, because the
# LZW-compatible code in Ghostscript doesn't actually compress its input.

BAND_LIST_COMPRESSOR=zlib

# Choose the implementation of file I/O: 'stdio', 'fd', or 'both'.
# See gs.mak and sfxfd.c for more details.

FILE_IMPLEMENTATION=stdio

# See gs.mak and ziodevs.c/ziodevsc.c for more details.

STDIO_IMPLEMENTATION=c
