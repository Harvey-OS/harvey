/*
 * Compositing is the next-to-last step in the rendering pipeline.
 * It occurs after color correction but before halftoning (if needed).
 *
 * gs_composite_t is the abstract superclass for compositing functions such
 * as RasterOp functions or alpha-based compositing.  Concrete subclasses
 * must provide a default implementation (presumably based on
 * get_bits_rectangle and copy_color) for devices that provide no optimized
 * implementation of their own.
 *
 * A client that wants to produce composited output asks the target device
 * to create an appropriate compositing device based on the target device
 * and the gs_composite_t (and possibly other elements of the imager state).
 * If the target device doesn't have its own implementation for the
 * requested function, format, and state, it passes the buck to the
 * gs_composite_t, which may make further tests for special cases before
 * creating and returning a compositing device that uses the default
 * implementation.
