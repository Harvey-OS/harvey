 * interface defined in gsmemory.h, retail allocators implement it as
 * well, and in fact the malloc interface defined in gsmalloc.h is used for
 * both wholesale and retail allocation.

/* Define the procedures for raw memory management.  Memory managers have no
 * standard constructor: each implementation defines its own, and is
 * responsible for calling its superclass' initialization code first.
 * Similarly, each implementation's destructor (release) must first take
 * care of its own cleanup and then call the superclass' release.
 *
 * The allocation procedures must align objects as strictly as malloc.
 * Formerly, the procedures were required to align objects as strictly
 * as the compiler aligned structure members.  However, the ANSI C standard
 * does not require this -- it only requires malloc to align blocks
 * strictly enough to prevent hardware access faults.  Thus, for example,
 * on the x86, malloc need not align blocks at all.  And in fact, we have
 * found one compiler (Microsoft VC 6) that 8-byte aligns 'double' members
 * of structures, but whose malloc only 4-byte aligns its blocks.
 * Ghostscript allocators could enforce the stricter alignment, but the
 * few dozen lines of code required to implement this were rejected during
 * code review as introducing too much risk for too little payoff.  As a
 * consequence of this,
 *
 *	CLIENTS CANNOT ASSUME THAT BLOCKS RETURNED BY ANY OF THE ALLOCATION
 *	PROCEDURES ARE ALIGNED ANY MORE STRICTLY THAN IS REQUIRED BY THE
 *	HARDWARE.
 *
 * In particular, clients cannot assume that blocks returned by an allocator
 * can be processed efficiently in any unit larger than a single byte: there
 * is no guarantee that accessing any larger quantity will not require two
 * memory accesses at the hardware level.  Clients that want to process data
 * efficiently in larger units must use ALIGNMENT_MOD to determine the
 * actual alignment of the data in memory.
 */
