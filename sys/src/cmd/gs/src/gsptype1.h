 * Make a pattern from a bitmap or pixmap. The pattern may be colored or
 * uncolored, as determined by the mask operand. This code is intended
 * primarily for use by PCL.
 *
 * By convention, if pmat is null the identity matrix will be used, and if
 * id is no_UniqueID the code will assign a unique id. Thes conventions allow
 * gs_makebitmappattern to be implemented as a macro. Also, if mem is a
 * null pointer, the memory allocator for the graphic state is used.
 *
 * For mask patterns, pix_depth must be 1, while pcspace and white_index are
 * ignored; the polarity of the mask considers ones part of the mask, while
 * zeros are not. For colored patterns pspace must point to an indexed color
 * space and the image must used the canoncial Decode array for this color
 * space. For both cases no interpolation or adjustment is provided.
 *
 * For backwards compatibility, if mask is false, pcspace is null, and
 * pix_depth is 1, the pattern will be rendered with a color space that maps
 * 0 to white and 1 to black.
 *
 * The image must be described by a gx_tile_bitmap structure (this is actually
 * somewhat awkward, but the only option available at the moment), and the
 * pattern step will exactly match the image size. The client need not maintain
 * the gx_tile_bitmap structure after the completion of this call, but the
 * raw image data itself must be kept until the pattern is no longer needed.
 *
 * NB: For proper handling of transparency in PCL, there must be only a single
 *     white value accessed by the pattern image. If the palette contains
 *     multiple white values, the PCL component must remap the image data to
 *     ensure that all white indices are mapped to the single, given white
 *     index.
