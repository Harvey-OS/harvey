8 June 1999 Zoltán Kócsi (aka Kocsonya) zoltan@bendor.com.au

	Initial revision. 
	No shingling, depletion.
	Colour only.
	Dither matrix is blatantly copied from gslib.c.

17 April 2000 Zoltán Kócsi

	After much play worked out a reasonably simple colour mapping
	that gives fairly good results. It has some very hairy things 
	in it but ot seems to work reasonably well on a variety of natural
	as well as artificial images.

CREDIT
~~~~~~
This driver was written from scratch, however, I have used the 
HP/BJ driver very heavily as a reference (GhostScript's documentation
needs some working :-). In addition, I got some help in understanding
the more arcane features of the printer by digging into the colour
Epson driver and its documentation (documentation for the Photo EX 
did not exist). I thank to the authors of these drivers and the 
related docs. 

I do also hereby express my despising Epson, Inc. who try to enlarge 
Microsoft's monopoly by witholding programming information about such 
a commodity item as a printer.

KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Monochrome driver is not finished yet
- The driver is not optimised for speed
- The driver does not support TIFF compression
- Shingling and depletion is not implemented
- The colour correction and ink transfer curve are hardcoded 
- The dither matrix is straight stolen from Ghostscript
- The alternative error diffusion included but does not work (yet)

I plan to attend these issues later, however, I don't promise any timeframe
for I have a lot else to do for bread & butter too.

PREFACE
~~~~~~~
The Epson Stylus Photo EX is a colour ink-jet printer.
It can handle papers up to A3. It uses 6 inks, black in one cartridge
and cyan, magenta, yellow, light cyan and light magenta in an other 
cartridge. The head has 32 nozzles, with 1/90" spacing. 
The maximal resolution is 1440 dpi horizontal 720 dpi vertical.
In 720x720 and 360x360 dpi it supports microweave. To achieve
1440x720 you must use software weaving. It has only one built-in font,
namely 12pt Courier; the printer in general havily relies on the
driver software. It comes with (what else ?) Windows 9x and Mac drivers.

The printer uses the ESC/P Raster protocol. This protocol is somewhat
similar to the ESC/P2 one. Initially Epson refused to give any info
about it. Later (unfortunately after I had already spent lot of time
to reverse engineer it) they released its definition. It could be 
found on their website (http://www.ercipd.com/isv/level1/6clr_98b.pdf).
Alas, they removed it, so at the moment I do not know about any existing
docs of the printer. 
There are still a few commands which are not covered by the docs
and for example the Windows driver uses them. There are others which
are in the docs, saying that you can find them in other docs but you 
can't. Fortunately, these commands apparently have no effect on the 
printing process so this driver simply ignores them. Tricky business.

By the way, my personal experience is that Epson tech support is 
a joke, or in Usenet lingvo it sucks big time - they know absolutely
nothing about the product they supposed to support. Epson's webpage
contains false info as well (they state that the Photo EX uses ESC/P2,
which is simply not true).

This driver should in theory support the Stylus 700 and the Stylus Photo
as well but I have not tested it on them.

If you think that you can get some useful info from me above of what you
can find below, feel free to email me at zoltan@bendor.com.au.
If you enhance the driver or find a bug *please* send me info about 
it. 

DRIVER
~~~~~~
The driver was written under Ghostscript 5.10.
This file should contain two drivers, one for colour mode and one for B&W.
The devices are "photoex" and "photoexm". The mono device driver is
catered for (that is, the rendering part knows how to render for B&W)
but it is not finished yet (no device structure and gray colour mapping
procedures) mainly because all my B&W needs are fairly well satisfied 
by our laser printer.

The driver features the following:

Supported resolutions

	 360x360	Y weaving (not that micro :-) by the printer
	 720x720	Y microweave by the driver (quicker than the printer)
	1440x720	Y and X microweave by the driver
	
	Resolutions other than these will result in a rangecheck error.
	
Papersize:
	
	Whatever Ghostscript supports. The printer docs say that if you load
	multiple sheets of transparencies into the tray you should at least
	have 30mm or 1.2" top margin. The driver always sets the smallest 
	possible top margin (3mm or 0.12"), it's up to you to comply.
	
	In addition, the printer says that the bottom margin is at least
	14mm or 0.54". I violate it by setting it to 0.5" or 12.7mm.
	0.5" seems to be a common margin value for documents and you 
	would hate it when the last line of your page gets printed on the
	top of the next sheet ...
	
Options:
	
	-dDotSize=n
	
		n = 0		Let the driver choose a dotsize
		n = 1		small dots
		n = 2		more ink
		n = 3		ink flood
		n = 4		'super microdots' (whatever they are, they are *big*)
		
		The default is 0 which is n=1 for 1440x720, 2 for 720x720 and
		3 for 360x360. Do not use large dots if you don't have to, you
		will soak the paper. If you print 720x720 on normal paper, try
		using n=1.
		
	-dRender=n
	
		n = 0		Floyd-Steinbeck error diffusion
		n = 1		Clustered dither
		n = 2		Bendor's error diffusion (experimental, do not use)
		
		Default is Floyd-Steinbeck error diffusion
		
	-dLeakage=nn
	
		nn is between 0 and 25. It only effects Bendor's error diffusion.
		It sets the percentage of the error which is left to 'leak', that
		is it is the coefficient of an exponential decay of the error.
		Experiments show that it can be beneficial on image quality.
		Default is 0 (no leakage).
		
	-dSplash=nn
	
		nn is between 0 and 100. It only affects Bendor's error diffusion.
		The ED routine tries to take the increase of dot diameter on certain
		paper types into account. 
		It sets the percentage of the ink dot size increase as it splashes
		onto the paper and spreads. 0 means no splashing, 100 means that 
		the dot is twice as large as it should be. 
		Default is 0.
		
	-dBinhibit=n
	
		If n is 1, then if black ink is deposited to a pixel, it will
		inhibit the deposition of any other ink to the same pixel.
		If 0, black ink may be deposited together with other inks.
		Default is on (1).
		 
ESC/P RASTER DOCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parts of the ESC/P Raster protocol which I've managed to decipher, 
and which are actually used in this driver can be found below.
nn, mm, xx, etc. represent a single byte with a binary value in it.
nnnn, xxxx etc. represent a 16-bit binary number, sent in two bytes,
in little endian order (low byte first). 2-digit numbers are a single 
byte in hex. Other chars are themselves.
Quite a few commands are identical to the ESC/P2 commands, these are 
marked with (P2).

ESC @								(P2)	
	
	Resets the printer.


ESC ( U 01 00 nn					(P2)

	Sets the unit to 3600/nn dpi. Note that 1440 can not be set !


ESC ( C 02 00 nnnn					(P2)

	Sets the page (paper) length to nnnn units
	

ESC ( c 04 00 bbbb tttt				(P2)

	Sets the top margin to tttt units, the bottom margin to
	bbbb units. The bottom margin is measured from the top
	of the page not from the bottom of the page !
		
	
ESC	U nn							(P2)

	Unidirectional printing
	
	nn
	00	off
	01	on
	30	off (this is ASCII 0)

ESC	( i 01 00 nn					(P2)

	Microweave
	
	nn
	00	off
	01	on
	30	off (this is ASCII 0)
	31	on	(this is ASCII 1)
	
	Turns microweave on for 720x720 dpi printing.
				
ESC r nn							(P2)

	Select colour
	
	nn
	01		Cyan
	02		Magenta
	04		Yellow
	08		Black
		

ESC ( G 01 00 nn					(P2)

	Selects graphics mode:
	
	nn
	00		Off
	01		On
	30		Off
	31		On
	
	
ESC ( v 02 00 dddd					(P2)

	Advance the paper by dddd units defined by ESC ( U


ESC . cc vv hh nn mmmm <data>		(P2)

	Sends graphics data to the printer.
	
	cc	Encoding mode
	
		00	Raw data
		01	Run-length encoded data
	
	vv	Vertical resolution
	
		28	  90 dpi	*interleave*
		14	 180 dpi	*interleave*
		0a	 360 dpi
		05	 720 dpi
		
	hh	Horizontal resolution
	
		0a	 360 dpi
		05	 720 dpi
		
	nn	Number of nozzles
	
		It should be set to 32 (normal printing) or 1 (microweave)
		
	mmmm Number of collumns of data (not number of data bytes !)
	
	<data>
	
		The data should contain as many bytes as needed to fill the
		mmmm * nn pixels. Data is presented horizontally, that is,
		the bits of a byte will be represented by eight pixels in
		a row. If the number of collumns is not an integer multiple 
		of eight, then some bits from the last byte belonging to the
		row will be discarded and the next row starts on a byte boundary.
		If a bit in a byte is '1' ink is deposited, if '0' not.
		The leftmost pixel is represented by the MSB, rightmost by LSB.
		In case of raw data that's about it.
		
		In case of run-length encoded data, the following is done:
		The first byte is a counter. If the counter is <= 127 then
		the following counter+1 bytes are uncompressed data.
		If the counter is >= 128 then the following single byte should
		be repeated 257-counter times. 
		
	There are resolution restrictions:
	
		360x360 nozzle= 1 microweave on
		360x360 nozzle=32 microweave off
		720x 90 nozzle=32 microweave off
		720x720	nozzle= 1 microweave on

	Other combinations are not supported.

ESC ( e 02 00 00 nn

	Sets the amount of ink spat onto the paper.
	
	nn
	01		microdots (faint printing)
	02		normal dots (not so faint printing)
	03		double dots (full inking)
	04		super microdots (ink is continuously dripping :-)
	
	Values other than that have apparently no effect.
	
ESC ( K 02 00 xxxx

	This command is sent by the Windows driver but it is not used
	in the Epson test images. I have not found it having any effect
	whatsoever. The driver does not use it. The Epson docs don't
	mention it.
	
ESC ( r 02 00 nn mm					
	
	Selects the ink according to this:

	nn mm
	00 00	black
	00 01	magenta
	00 02	cyan
	00 04	yellow
	01 01	light magenta
	01 02	light yellow


ESC ( \ 04 00 xxxx llll

	Horizontal positioning of the head.
	
	Moves the head to the position llll times 1/xxxx inches from
	the left margin. 
	On the example images xxxx was always set to 1440.
	I tried other values in which case the command was ignored,
	so stick to 1440.

	
ESC ( R ll 00 00 <text> <cc> xxxx nn .. nn 
ESC 00 00 00

	This is supposedly sets the printer into 'remote' mode.
	ll is the length of the <text> + 1 which consists of ASCII
	characters (e.g. REMOTE1). 
	<cc> is a two-character code, for example "SN" or "LD".
	xxxx is the number of bytes (nn -s) which will follow.
	After that there's either a new <cc> xxxx nn .. nn sequence or
	the ESC 00 00 00.
	I have absolutely no idea about this command and the Epson document
	says that it's in an other document. It's not in that other one.
	The driver does not use it. The printer does not miss it.
	The Epson test images use it and the Windows driver uses it too.
	They send different <cc>-s and different values for identical <cc>-s.
	Go figure.
	
DRIVER INTERNALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, some comments.
Anything I know about the printer can be found above. 
Anything I know about Ghostscript internals (not much) can be 
found in the comments in the code. I do not believe in the 'it was hard 
to write, it should be hard to read' principle since I once had to 
understand my own code.
Therefore, the code has lots of comments in it, sometimes apparently
superfluous but I find it easier to understand the program 6 months 
later that way.
I did not follow the Ghostscript or GNU style guide, I write code the way
I like it - I'm a lazy dog :-) I use hard tabs at every 4th position,
I use a *lot* of whitespace (as recommended by K&R in their original
C book) and I have a formatting style similar to the K&R with the 
notable exception that I do not indent variable declarations that follow 
the curly. Anyway, you can run your favourite C formatter through the 
source.

In addition to the above, the driver is not hand-optimised, it assumes 
that it is compiled with a good optimising compiler which will handle
common subexpression ellimination, move loop independent code out of
the loop, transform repeated array accesses to cached pointer arithmetics
and so on. The code is much more readable this way and gcc is fairly 
good at doing optimisation. Feel free to hand-optimise it.

So, the driver works the following way:

When it has to render a page, first it sets up the basics such as margins
and papersize and alike.

Line scheduling
---------------

Then it calls the line scheduler. To see why do we have a scheduler, you
have to understand weaving. The printer head has 32 nozzles which are
spaced at 8 line intervals. Therefore, it prints 32 lines at a time but they
are distributed over a 256 line high area. Obviously, if you want to print 
all the lines under the head, you should pass over the paper 8 times.  
You can do it the obvious way:
Print, move down by one line, print ... repeat 8 times then move down
by 256 - 8 lines and start again. Unfortunately, this would result in
stripy images due to the differences between individual nozzles.
Lines 0-7 would be printed by nozzle 0, 8-15 by nozzle 1 and so on. An
8 line band has a visible height, so difference between nozzles will
cause 8-line high bands to appear on the image.

The solution is 'microweave', a funny way of doing interlaced printing.
Instead of moving down 1, 1, 1, 1, .. 1, 248, 1, 1 .. you move down
a constant, larger amount (called a band). This amount must be chosen 
in such a way that each line will be printed and preferably it will be 
printed only once.

Let for example the move down amount (the band) be 31. Let's say, 
in band N nozzle 31 is over line 300, in which case nozzle 30 is over
line 292. We move the head down by 31 lines, then line 299 will be 
under nozzle 27 and line 307 under nozzle 28.
Next move, nozzle 23 will print line 298 and nozzle 24 line 306, then
19/297 20/305, 15/296 16/304, 11/295 12/303, 7/294 8/302, 3/293 4/302,
0/292 3/301 which covers the entire area between 292 and 307. 
The same will apply to any other area on the page. Also note that 
adjacent lines are always printed by different nozzles. 
You probably have realised that line 292 was printed in the first pass
and in the last one. In this case, of course, the line must not be printed 
twice, one or the other pass should not deliver data to the nozzle which
passes over this line.

Now there's a twist. When the horizontal resolution is 1440 dpi you have
to print each line twice, first depositing all even pixels then offset
the head by 1/1440" and deposit all odd pixels (the printer can only
print with 720 dpi but you can initially position the head with 1440 dpi
resolution). You could do it the easy way, passing over the same area 
twice but you can do better. You can find a band size which will result 
each line being printed twice. Instead of suppressing the double print, 
you use this mechanism to print the odd and the even pixels.
Now if you print one line's odd pixels, obviously, all lines belonging
to the 31 other nozzles of the head will have their odd pixels printed too.
Therefore, you have to keep track which lines have been printed in which
phase and try to find an odd-even phase assignment to bands so that each line
has both groups printed (and each group only once). 
The added bonus is that even the same line will be printed by two different
nozzles thus effects of nozzle differences can be decreased further.

The whole issue is further complicated with the beginning of the page and 
the end of the page. When you print the first 8 lines you *must* use the
print, down by 1, print ... method but then you have to switch over to the
banding method. To do it well, you should minimise the number of lines which
are printed out of band. This optimisation is not complex but not trivial 
either. Our solution is to employ precalculated tables for the first 8 lines.
(Epson's solution is not to print the 'problematic' lines at all - they
warn you in the manual that at the top and bottom you may have "slight
distortions". Analyzing their output reveals the reason ... ).
The bottom is different. It is easier, because you are already banding, so 
you can't screw up the rest of the image. On the other hand, you can't use
tables because these tables would depend on the page height which you don't
know a priori. Our solution is to switch to single line mode when we can 
not do the banding any more and try to finish the page with the minimal 
amount of passes.

So, first the driver calls the scheduler which returns a list of lines which 
it dispatched to print in the current band. Then the driver checks if it has 
all these lines halftoned. Since the head covers an area of 256 lines, we 
have to buffer that many lines (actually, 256-7). As the head moves down, 
we can flush lines which it has left and halftone the new ones.


Colour transformations
----------------------

The next important issue is the colour transformation. The reason for doing
this is that the ink is not perfect. Ideally, you have 3 inks, namely cyan
magenta and yellow. Mixing these you can have all colours. Now the inks
are not pure, that is the cyan ink contains some particles that have a
colour other than the ideal cyan and so on. In addition, the inks are
not exactly cyan, magenta and yellow. Therefore, you have to do some
transformations that will map the ideal C, M, Y values to amounts of
ink of the real kind. You also have a black ink. Although in theory
mixing C, M, Y in equal amount will give you black, it doesn't exactly
work that way. In addition, black ink is cheap compared to the colour
so if you can use black, you rather use that. On top of all that, 
because of other effects (ink splashing on the paper and things like that) 
you have to apply some non-linear functions to get reasonable colours.

Halftoning
----------

The driver has different halftoning methods.
There is the classic Floyd-Stenberg error diffusion. There is an other
ED, of which I'm hammering the matrix. The matrix is larger than the
FS one and IMHO results in somewhat lower halftoning noise. However,
it completely screws up some flat colours so don't use it.
There is also dithering, which is quick but noisy.

For any halftoning method, it is assumed that the haltoning can be 
done on the 4 colours (CMYK) separately and all interdependencies are
already handled. It is an optimistic assumption, however, close enough.

You can add any halftoning method you like by writing a halftoner
module. A halftoner module consists of 4 functions:

- Init, which is called before halftoning starts.
- Threshold, which should return a number which tells the driver how many
  empty lines needed before halftoning can be stopped (i.e. for how many 
  lines will a line affect halftoning of subsequent lines).
- Halftone, which halftones one colour of one line
- EndOfLine which is called when all colours of a scanline are halftoned,
  you can do your housekeeping functions here.

For example, in the case of ED init() clears the error buffers, threshold()
returns ~5 (5 empty lines are enough for the accumulated error to go to 
almost zero), endofline() shuffles the error buffers and halftone() itself
does the error diffusion. In case of dithering, threshold is 0 (dithering
has no memory), init and endofline do nothing and halftone simply
dithers a line.

A few options are available for all halftoners:

- the black is rendered first. Now this black line is presented to all
  further passes. If a pixel is painted black, there's no point to
  deposit any other colour on it, even if the halftoning itself would do.
  Therefore, an already set black pixel can block the halftoning of colours
  for that pixel. Whether this thing is activated or not is a command line
  switch (default is on). Your halftoner may choose to ignore this flag.
  
- the intensity value of the light-cyan and light-magenta ink can be
  set from the command line. My experience is that the default 127 is
  good enough, but you can override it if you want to.
  
Apart from these features, each halftoner can have all sorts of other 
switches. Currently there are switches for the Bendor ED, see the 
comments in front of the BendorLine() function to see what they are.

Postprocessing
--------------

After lines are halftoned, they are packed into bitstreams. If you use
1440x720 then the 2 passes for the horizontal interleave are separated.
Postprocessing should also do the shingling/depletion, but it is not
yet done.

Compression
-----------

The driver, before it sends the data to the printer, compresses it using
RLE (run-length encoding) compression. It is not very effective but still
more than nothing. I have not yet ventured into using TIFF as output format,
it may come later.

*
*				 *	20	10  r
*		8	14	20	14	 8
*		4	 8	10	 8	 4
*
*	We also try to take the splashing effect into account (the ink disperses
*	when it hits the paper so it partially covers surrounding pixels).
*	We use an other matrix for that, which is very simple:
*
*			*	3
*		2	3	2
*
*	and the normalisation factor can be set by the user. 
*	The splash matrix is only applied if we have actually deposited 
*	ink and the amount added to the errors is independent that of the 
*	actual image value, it only depends on the ink applied.
*	Of course, the ink spreads up and left as well and we could compensate
*	for this for a certain extent by keeping track of the errors caused in
*	previous pixels and lines and modifying them accordingly but it
*	would lead to a horrible code mess and it wouldn't be worth the effort.
*
*	A further enhancement that we allow the error to 'leak'. Experimental 
*	results show that with a 5-15% loss of error the image quality 
*	increases and the colour distortion remains very low. If you think
*	about it, this, in effect stops the error to spread its effect over
*	large areas but it will have almost undisturbed effect on neighbouring 
*	areas (you allow for an exponential error decay). 
*	This parameter is user definable, too.
