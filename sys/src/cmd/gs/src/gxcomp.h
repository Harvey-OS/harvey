/*
 * Because compositor information is passed through the command list,
 * individual compositors must be identified by some means that is
 * independent of address space. The address of the compositor method
 * array, gs_composite_type_t (see below), cannot be used, as it is
 * meaningful only within a single address space.
 *
 * In addition, it is desirable the keep the compositor identifier
 * size as small as possible, as this identifier must be passed through
 * the command list for all bands whenever the compositor is invoked.
 * Fortunately, compositor invocation is not so frequent as to warrant
 * byte-sharing techniques, which most likely would store the identifier
 * in some unused bits of a command code byte. Hence, the smallest
 * reasonable size for the identifier is one byte. This allows for up
 * to 255 compositors, which should be ample (as of this writing, there
 * are only two compositors, only one of which can be passed through
 * the command list).
 *
 * The following list is intended to enumerate all compositors. We
 * use definitions rather than an encoding to ensure a one-byte size.
