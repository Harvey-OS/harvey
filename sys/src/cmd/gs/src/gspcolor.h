/*
 * We originally defined the gs_client_pattern structure before we
 * realized that we would have to accommodate multiple PatternTypes.
 * In version 5.68, we bit the bullet and made an incompatible change
 * to this structure so that multiple PatternTypes could be supported.
 * In order to make this work:
 *
 *	Clients creating instances of any Pattern template structure
 *	(gs_patternN_template_t) must call gs_patternN_init to
 *	initialize all the members, before filling in any of the
 *	members themselves.
 *
 * This is a non-backward-compatible requirement relative to previous
 * versions, but it was unavoidable.
