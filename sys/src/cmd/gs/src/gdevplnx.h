/*
 * A plane-extraction device appears to its client to be a color-capable
 * device, like its target; but it actually extracts a single color plane
 * for rendering to yet another device, called the plane device (normally,
 * but not necessarily, a memory device).  Clients must know the pixel
 * representation in detail, since the plane is specified as a particular
 * group of bits within the pixel.
 *
 * The original purpose of plane-extraction devices is for band list
 * rendering for plane-oriented color printers.  Each per-plane rasterizing
 * pass over the band list sends the output to a plane-extraction device for
 * the plane being printed.  There is one special optimization to support
 * this: on the theory that even bands containing output for multiple bands
 * are likely to have many objects that only write white into that band, we
 * remember whether any (non-white) marks have been made on the page so far,
 * and if not, we simply skip any rendering operations that write white.
 *
 * The depth of the plane_extract device and its target are limited to 32
 * bits; the depth of each plane is limited to 8 bits.  We could raise these
 * without too much trouble if necessary, as long as each plane didn't
 * exceed 32 bits.
