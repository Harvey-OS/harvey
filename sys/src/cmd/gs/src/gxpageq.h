/* --------------- Data type definitions --------------------- */

/*	Action codes for each page queue entry. Each page that the interpreter
	emits to the page queue can actually be broken down into a sequence of
	one or more page queue entries. The general form for a given page's
	sequence of page queue entries can be expressed as:
		[PARTIAL_PAGE]... [COPY_PAGE [PARTIAL_PAGE]...]... FULL_PAGE
	where elements in square brackets are optional, and ellipses show
	repetition. NOTE that a single ACTION_TERMINATE (followed by nothing) can
	also show up at any point in the page queue in lieu of page descriptions.


	PARTIAL_PAGE: The interpreter emits a partial page when the bandlist is
	too small to contain a page's full representation. Partial pages will
	be emitted in out-of-memory situations *only* after the interpreter
	has determined that no further page queue entries are in the page
	queue, indicating that no further memory can be reclaimed by merely
	waiting for queued pages to render and free their associated bandlist.

	Note that num_copies is undefined for partial pages: the actual
	number of pages to render will only be known when ...COPY_PAGE
	or FULL_PAGE is emitted.

	Partial pages are never imaged.


	FULL_PAGE: The interpreter emits a full page when a page description
	is complete (e.g. showpage), or trashed (e.g. setpagedevice). The
	page's complete description consists of the FULL_PAGE plus all
	PARTIAL_PAGEs that immediately precede it in the page queue (and
	possibly preceding COPY_PAGEs) all the way back to the previous
	FULL_PAGE (or up to the beginning of queue entries).

	In the case of a trashed page, the page count will be 0. The page
	queue may choose to not render the 0-count FULL_PAGE queue entry
	for efficiency. If they have not been rendered, the page queue
	may choose to also discard (and/or not render) any PARTIAL_PAGEs
	leading up to the trashed page. The page queue must however take
	care to not discard any entries leading up to a COPY_PAGE with
	a non-0 page count that may precede the FULL_PAGE, since COPY_PAGE
	must be rendered in that case. In any event, a 0-count page will
	not be imaged.

	In the case of a complete page, the page count will be 0 or greater.
	The 0-count page is equivalent to a trashed page -- see above. The
	renderer must ensure that all PARTIAL_PAGEs and COPY_PAGEs leading
	up to the FULL_PAGE are rendered sequentially before rendering
	and imaging the FULL_PAGE.


	COPY_PAGE: is similar to FULL_PAGE above, except that COPY_PAGE must
	keep the rendered results, instead of clearing them. COPY_PAGE
	differs from a partial page in that the page must be imaged, as well
	as rasterized. This is to support PostScript language "copypage"
	semantics.

	Note that a 0 page count here does not absolve the renderer from
	rendering the page queue entries (unless all subsequent COPY_PAGEs
	the the FULL_PAGE for this page also have a 0 page count), since
	the results of COPY_PAGE must be available for subsequent pages.


	TERMINATE: This entry can appear at any time in the page queue. It
	will be the last entry to ever appear in the queue. The semantics
	of this entry require all prior non-zero-count COPY_PAGEs and 
	FULL_PAGEs to be imaged. Any trailing PARTIAL_PAGEs may optionally
	be rendered, but should not be imaged.
