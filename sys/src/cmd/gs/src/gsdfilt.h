/* The device filter stack lives in the gs_state structure. It represents
   a chained sequence of devices that filter device requests, each forwarding
   to its target. The last such target is the physical device as set by
   setpagedevice.

   There is a "shadow" gs_device_filter_stack_s object for each device in
   the chain. The stack management uses these objects to keep track of the
   chain.
