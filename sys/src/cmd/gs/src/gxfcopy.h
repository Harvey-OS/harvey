 * Copy a font, aside from its glyphs.  Note that PostScript-specific data
 * -- that is, data that do not appear in the C structure that is the
 * relevant subclass of gs_font -- are NOT copied.  In particular,
 * Metrics[2], CDevProc, and FontInfo are not copied, except for the
 * information returned by font->procs.font_info (see the definition of
 * gs_font_info_t in gxfont.h).
 *
 * Note that in some cases the font must have a definition for the "not
 * defined" glyph, as noted below, or a rangecheck error occurs.
 *
 * The following FontTypes are supported:
 *
 *	Type 1, Type 2 - Encoding and CharStrings are not copied.  Subrs and
 *	GlobalSubrs (for CFFs) are copied; OtherSubrs are not copied.  The
 *	font must have a glyph named .notdef; its definition is copied.
 *
 *	Type 42 (TrueType) - Encoding and CharStrings are not copied.  The
 *	TrueType glyf and loca tables are not copied, nor are the bogus
 *	Adobe gdir, glyx, and locx "tables".  If the font has a definition
 *	for a glyph named .notdef (in the CharStrings dictionary), the
 *	definition is copied.
 *
 *	CIDFontType 0 (Type 1/2-based CIDFonts) - the glyph data are not
 *	copied.  The Type 1/2 subfonts *are* copied, as are the Subrs (both
 *	local and global).
 *
 *	CIDFontType 2 (TrueType-based CIDFonts) - the glyph data and CIDMap
 *	are not copied.
 *
 * The resulting font supports querying (font_info, glyph_info, etc.) and
 * rendering (glyph_outline, etc.), but it does not support make_font.

 * Copy a glyph, including any sub-glyphs.  The destination font ("copied"
 * argument) must be a font created by gs_copy_font.  The source font
 * ("font" argument) must have the same FontType as the destination, and in
 * addition must be "compatible" with it as described under the individual
 * FontTypes just below; however, gs_copy_glyph does not check
 * compatibility.
 *
 * If any glyph has already been copied but does not have the same
 * definition as the one being copied now, gs_copy_glyph returns an
 * invalidaccess error.  If the top-level glyph has already been copied
 * (with the same definition), gs_copy_glyph returns 1.  Otherwise,
 * gs_copy_glyph returns 0.
 *
 *	Type 1, Type 2 - the destination and source must have the same
 *	Subrs.  glyph must be a name (not an integer).  Copies the
 *	CharString entry.  Note that the Type 1/2 'seac' operator requires
 *	copying not only the sub-glyphs but their Encoding entries as well.
 *
 *	Type 42 - the destination and source must have compatible tables
 *	other than glyf and loca.  In practice this means that the source
 *	must be the same font that was passed to gs_copy_font.  If glyph is
 *	an integer, it is interpreted as a GID; if glyph is a name, both
 *	the CharString entry and the glyph data are copied.
 *
 *	CIDFontType 0 - the destination and source must have the same Subrs,
 *	and the Type 1/2 subfont(s) referenced by the glyph(s) being copied
 *	must be compatible.  glyph must be a CID.  Copies the CharString.
 *
 *	CIDFontType 2 - compatibility is as for Type 42.  glyph must be a
 *	CID (integer), not a GID.  Copies the glyph data and the CIDMap
 *	entry.
 *
 * Metrics[2] and CDevProc in the source font are ignored.  Currently,
 * for CIDFontType 2 fonts with MetricsCount != 0, the metrics attached to
 * the individual glyph outlines are also ignored (not copied).
