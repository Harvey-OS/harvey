     This file holds the sample-implementation of a RGB-algorithm for
     the stcolor-driver. It is available via

          gs -sDEVICE=stcolor -sDithering=gsrgb ...

     Actually this is no dithering-algorithm, it lets ghostscript do the job.
     This achieved, by requesting BYTE-Values between 0 and 1 to be delivered,
     which causes a depth of 1-Bit by default.
