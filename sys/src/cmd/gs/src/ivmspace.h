/*
 * According to the PostScript language specification, attempting to store
 * a reference to a local object into a global object must produce an
 * invalidaccess error.  However, systemdict must be able to refer to
 * a number of local dictionaries such as userdict and errordict.
 * Therefore, we implement a special hack in 'def' that allows such stores
 * if the dictionary being stored into is systemdict (which is normally
 * only writable during initialization) or a dictionary that appears
 * in systemdict (such as level2dict), and the current save level is zero
 * (to guarantee that we can't get dangling pointers).
 * We could allow this for any global dictionary, except that the garbage
 * collector must treat any such dictionaries as roots when collecting
 * local VM without collecting global VM.
 * We make a similar exception for .makeglobaloperator; this requires
 * treating the operator table as a GC root as well.
 *
 * We extend the local-into-global store check because we have four VM
 * spaces (local, global, system, and foreign), and we allow PostScript
 * programs to create objects in any of the first three.  If we define
 * the "generation" of an object as foreign = 0, system = 1, global = 2,
 * and local = 3, then a store is legal iff the generation of the object
 * into which a pointer is being stored is greater than or equal to
 * the generation of the object into which the store is occurring.
 *
 * We must check for local-into-global stores in three categories of places:
 *
 *      - The scanner, when it encounters a //name inside {}.
 *
 *      - All operators that allocate ref-containing objects and also
 *      store into them:
 *              packedarray  gstate  makepattern?
 *              makefont  scalefont  definefont  filter
 *
 *      - All operators that store refs into existing objects
 *      ("operators" marked with * are actually PostScript procedures):
 *              put(array)  putinterval(array)  astore  copy(to array)
 *              def  store*  put(dict)  copy(dict)
 *              dictstack  execstack  .make(global)operator
 *              currentgstate  defineusername
