/* Dropout prevention for a character rasterization. */

#ifndef gxfdrop_INCLUDED
#define gxfdrop_INCLUDED

/*  The structure margin_set and related structures and functions are used for 
    preventing dropouts rasterizing a character with zero fill adjustment. The purpose
    is to paint something along thin quazi-horizontal stems,
    which are composed of multiple small segments (such as a result of flattenpath).
    We call it "pseudo-rasterization".
    When fill adjustment takes place, this stuff is not required and is being skipped.

    To prevent dropouts in thin quazi-horizontal stems we look at raster
    through 1xN pixels window, where N is the width of the path bounding box.
    This window moves from bottom to top synchronousely with the motion of
    the filling loop, but its Y coordinate is always an integer plus one half
    (actually it moves convulsively).
    Through this window we can see an upper half of a pixel row,
    and lower half of the next pixel row. Painted spots are visible through
    this window as a set of "margins". To handle them we maintain
    a list of margin_s structures (each of which describes an interval
    to be painted), and array of "sections" (i-th section corresponds to
    half-integer X-coordinate Xi = bbox_left + i + 0.5, and stores fraction
    part of y-coordinate of intersection of the line x == Xi with margin
    boudaries, being visible through window (only extremal coordinates are stored 
    into a section)).
 
    The structure margin_set snaps what has been painted inside window.
    We handle 2 instances of margin_set : margin_set0 is being prepared and margin_set1 is
    being refinished. When the filling loop steps down over a pixel center,
    the refinished window is closed and released, the prapared window becomes
    the refinished one, and a new one starts to prepare.

    fixme:
    The current implementation is not optimised for very bold characters.
    We could encrease performance for them with maintaining
    a separate list of "exclusive" margins, which correspond
    to intervals painted with regular trapezoids and made with
    complete_margin. Using them we could skip access to 'sect' array elements
    inside "exclusive" margins, so that the number of small steps
    sensibly decreeses.

    fixme:
    Another optimization could be applied to the regular(old) trapezoid algorithm.
    Currently it breaks stems at any step of the Y cycle,
    generating big number of trapezoids.
    Perhaps we could store trapezoid vertices to active_line,
    and delay rendering a trapezoid until stem changes boundary segments.
    This also would make calls to the margin staff less frequent.
