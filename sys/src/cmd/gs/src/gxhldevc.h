/*
 * Most high level devices want more information about the color spaces
 * which were used to create color values.
 *
 * There are some added complications:
 *
 * 1. Ghostscript has many dozens, if not hundreds, of device drivers which
 * have been written for it.  Many of these devices are outside of our
 * control.  (However we do receive questions and complaints when they no
 * longer work.)  Thus we also want to avoid making changes in the device
 * interface which would require changes to the code in these devices.
 *
 * 2. We also desire to not save pointers to color space structures, etc.
 * within the high level device.  Many of these structures are temporary,
 * stack based, or are deleted outside of the control of the device.  Thus
 * it becomes almost impossible to prevent pointers to deleted objects.
 *
 * 3. Both color spaces and device colors are passed to devices via pointers
 * to objects.  These objects, in turn, often contain pointers to other
 * objects.
 *
 * These constraints imply the need within the device to save color spaces
 * and colors in some form which will allows us to detect color space or
 * color changes when a new color space and a color is compared to the old
 * saved color space and color.  These 'saved' forms should not include
 * pointers to objects outside of the control of the device.
 *
 * The functions below are desiged to assist the high level device in the
 * saving, comparing, and getting high level color information.
