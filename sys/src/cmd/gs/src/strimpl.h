/*
 * The 'process' procedure does the real work of the stream.
 * It must process as much input information (from pr->ptr + 1 through
 * pr->limit) as it can, subject to space available for output
 * (pw->ptr + 1 through pw->limit), updating pr->ptr and pw->ptr.
 *
 * The procedure return value must be one of:
 *      EOFC - an end-of-data pattern was detected in the input,
 *        or no more input can be processed for some other reason (e.g.,
 *        the stream was told only to read a certain amount of data).
 *      ERRC - a syntactic error was detected in the input.
 *      0 - more input data is needed.
 *      1 - more output space is needed.
 * If the procedure returns EOFC, it can assume it will never be called
 * again for that stream.
 *
 * If the procedure is called with last = 1, this is an indication that
 * no more input will ever be supplied (after the input in the current
 * buffer defined by *pr); the procedure should produce as much output
 * as possible, including an end-of-data marker if applicable.  In this
 * case:
 *      - If the procedure returns 1, it may be called again (also with
 *        last = 1).
 *      - If the procedure returns any other value other than 1, the
 *        procedure will never be called again for that stream.
 *      - If the procedure returns 0, this is taken as equivalent to
 *        returning EOFC.
 *      - If the procedure returns EOFC (or 0), the stream's end_status
 *        is set to EOFC, meaning no more writing is allowed.
 *
 * Note that these specifications do not distinguish input from output
 * streams.  This is deliberate: The processing procedures should work
 * regardless of which way they are oriented in a stream pipeline.
 * (The PostScript language does take a position as whether any given
 * filter may be used for input or output, but this occurs at a higher level.)
 *
 * The value returned by the process procedure of a stream whose data source
 * or sink is external (i.e., not another stream) is interpreted slightly
 * differently.  For an external data source, a return value of 0 means
 * "no more input data are available now, but more might become available
 * later."  For an external data sink, a return value of 1 means "there is
 * no more room for output data now, but there might be room later."
 *
 * It appears that the Adobe specifications, read correctly, require that when
 * the process procedure of a decoding filter has filled up the output
 * buffer, it must still peek ahead in the input to determine whether or not
 * the next thing in the input stream is EOD.  If the next thing is an EOD (or
 * end-of-data, indicated by running out of input data with last = true), the
 * process procedure must return EOFC; if the next thing is definitely not
 * an EOD, the process procedure must return 1 (output full) (without, of
 * course, consuming the non-EOD datum); if the procedure cannot determine
 * whether or not the next thing is an EOD, it must return 0 (need more input).
 * Decoding filters that don't have EOD (for example, NullDecode) can use
 * a simpler algorithm: if the output buffer is full, then if there is more
 * input, return 1, otherwise return 0 (which is taken as EOFC if last
 * is true).  All this may seem a little awkward, but it is needed in order
 * to have consistent behavior regardless of where buffer boundaries fall --
 * in particular, if a buffer boundary falls just before an EOD.  It is
 * actually quite easy to implement if the main loop of the process
 * procedure tests for running out of input rather than for filling the
 * output: with this structure, exhausting the input always returns 0,
 * and discovering that the output buffer is full when attempting to store
 * more output always returns 1.
 *
 * Even this algorithm for handling end-of-buffer is not sufficient if an
 * EOD falls just after a buffer boundary, but the generic stream code
 * handles this case: the process procedures need only do what was just
 * described.
 */

/*
 * The set_defaults procedure in the template has a dual purpose: it sets
 * default values for all parameters that the client can set before calling
 * the init procedure, and it also must initialize all pointers in the
 * stream state to a value that will be valid for the garbage collector
 * (normally 0).  The latter implies that:
 *
 *	Any stream whose state includes additional pointers (beyond those
 *	in stream_state_common) must have a set_defaults procedure.
 */

/*
 * Note that all decoding filters that require an explicit EOD in the
 * source data must have an init procedure that sets min_left = 1.
 * This effectively provides a 1-byte lookahead in the source data,
 * which is required so that the stream can close itself "after reading
 * the last byte of data" (per Adobe specification), as noted above.
 */

/*
 * Define a template for creating a stream.
 *
 * The meaning of min_in_size and min_out_size is the following:
 * If the amount of input information is at least min_in_size,
 * and the available output space is at least min_out_size,
 * the process procedure guarantees that it will make some progress.
 * (It may make progress even if this condition is not met, but this is
 * not guaranteed.)
