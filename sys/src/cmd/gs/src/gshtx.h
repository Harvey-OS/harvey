 *
 *    Construction of a gs_ht halftone requires two steps: creating the
 *    overall halftone, and creating each of the components. Client data
 *    must be provided for each of the latter steps.
 *
 *    The type field of gs_ht halftones will always be ht_type_multiple;
 *    if only one component is required, this halftone will always be given
 *    the component name "Default".
 *
 *    The type fields of the gs_ht_component structures pointed to by the
 *    gs_multiple_ht structure will have the value ht_type_spot or
 *    ht_type_threshold; the constructor routines will not build any
 *    other types.
 *
 *    Individual component halftones of a gs_ht structure must always be
 *    provided with transfer functions.
 *
 *    Releasing the gs_ht structure will NOT release the client data
 *    (the client must do that directly).
