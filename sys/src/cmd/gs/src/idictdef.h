/*
 * A dictionary of capacity M is a structure containing the following
 * elements (refs):
 *
 *      keys - a t_shortarray or t_array of M+1 elements, containing
 *      the keys.
 *
 *      values - a t_array of M+1 elements, containing the values.
 *
 *      count - a t_integer whose value tells how many entries are
 *      occupied (N).
 *
 *      maxlength - a t_integer whose value gives the client's view of
 *      the capacity (C).  C may be less than M (see below).
 *
 *      memory - a foreign t_struct referencing the allocator used to
 *      create this dictionary, which will also be used to expand or
 *      unpack it if necessary.
 *
 * C < M is possible because on large-memory systems, we usually round up M
 * so that M is a power of 2 (see idict.h for details); this allows us to
 * use masking rather than division for computing the initial hash probe.
 * However, C is always the maxlength specified by the client, so clients
 * get a consistent story.
 *
 * As noted above, the keys may be either in packed or unpacked form.
 * The markers for unused and deleted entries are different in the two forms.
 * In the packed form:
 *      unused entries contain packed_key_empty;
 *      deleted entries contain packed_key_deleted.
 * In the unpacked form:
 *      unused entries contain a literal null;
 *      deleted entries contain an executable null.
 *
 * The first entry is always marked deleted, to reduce the cost of the
 * wrap-around check.
 *
 * Note that if the keys slot in the dictionary is new,
 * all the key slots are new (more recent than the last save).
 * We use this fact to avoid saving stores into packed keys
 * for newly created dictionaries.
 *
 * Note that name keys with indices above packed_name_max_index require using
 * the unpacked form.  */
