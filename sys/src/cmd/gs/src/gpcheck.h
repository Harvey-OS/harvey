/*
 * On some platforms, the interpreter must check periodically for user-
 * initiated actions.  (Eventually, this may be extended to all platforms,
 * to handle multi-tasking through the 'context' facility.)  Routines that
 * run for a long time must periodically call gp_check_interrupts(), and
 * if it returns true, must clean up whatever they are doing and return an
 * e_interrupted (or gs_error_interrupted) exceptional condition.
 * The return_if_interrupt macro provides a convenient way to do this.
 *
 * On platforms that require an interrupt check, the makefile defines
 * a symbol CHECK_INTERRUPTS.  Currently this is only the Microsoft
 * Windows platform.
