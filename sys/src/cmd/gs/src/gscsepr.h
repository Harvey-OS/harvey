 * Separation color spaces.
 *
 * With the implementation of full DeviceN support, the API for creating
 * A Separation color space object has changed.  Separation color spaces
 * are treated as a single component version of a DeviceN color space.
 * The /All separation and the /None separation are the only exceptions.
 * The /All separation and the /None separation is each treated as its own
 * case and thus forms the majority of the remaining Separation color space
 * code.
 *
 * The earlier API which had a multi element cache has been removed.
 * The tint transform procedure now is executed as required and must
 * be executable without doing a call out.
