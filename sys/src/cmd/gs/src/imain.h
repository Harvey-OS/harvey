 * The interpreter requires three initialization steps, called init0,
 * init1, and init2.  These steps must be done in that order, but
 * init1 may be omitted.
 */

/*
 * init0 records the files to be used for stdio, and initializes the

 */

 * The runlibfile operator uses a search path, as described in
 * Use.htm, for looking up file names.  Each interpreter instance has
 * its own search path.  The following call adds a directory or set of
 * directories to the search path; it is equivalent to the -I command
 * line switch.  It may be called any time after init0.
 */

 *
 *      -d/D, -s/S (for setting device parameters like OutputFile)
 *              Use the C API for device parameters documented near the
 *              end of gsparam.h.
 *
 *      -d/D (for setting Boolean parameters like NOPAUSE)
 *              { ref vtrue;
 *                make_true(&vtrue);
 *                dict_put_string(systemdict, "NOPAUSE", &vtrue);
 *              }
 *      -I
 *              Use gs_main_add_lib_path, documented above.
 *
 *      -A, -A-
 *              Set gs_debug['@'] = 1 or 0 respectively.
 *      -E, -E-
 *              Set gs_debug['#'] = 1 or 0 respectively.
 *      -Z..., -Z-...
 *              Set gs_debug[c] = 1 or 0 respectively for each character
 *              c in the string.
 */

/* ---------------- Execution ---------------- */

/*
 * After initializing the interpreter, clients may pass it files or
 * strings to be interpreted.  There are four ways to do this:
 *      - Pass a file name (gs_main_run_file);
 *      - Pass a C string (gs_main_run_string);
 *      - Pass a string defined by pointer and length
 *              (gs_main_run_string_with_length);
 *      - Pass strings piece-by-piece
 *              (gs_main_run_string_begin/continue/end).
 *
 * The value returned by the first three of these calls is
 * 0 if the interpreter ran to completion, e_Quit for a normal quit,
 * or e_Fatal for a non-zero quit or a fatal error.
 * e_Fatal stores the exit code in the third argument.
 * The str argument of gs_main_run_string[_with_length] must be allocated
 * in non-garbage-collectable space (e.g., by malloc or gs_malloc,
 * or statically).
 */

 * The next 3 procedures provide for feeding input to the interpreter
 * in arbitrary chunks, unlike run_string, which requires that each string
 * be a properly formed PostScript program fragment.  To use them:
 *      Call run_string_begin.
 *      Call run_string_continue as many times as desired,
 *        stopping if it returns anything other than e_NeedInput.
 *      If run_string_continue didn't indicate an error or a quit
 *        (i.e., a return value other than e_NeedInput), call run_string_end
 *        to provide an EOF indication.
 * Note that run_string_continue takes a pointer and a length, like
 * run_string_with_length.

/* ---------------- Operand stack access ---------------- */

/*
 * The following procedures are not used in normal operation;
 * they exist only to allow clients driving the interpreter through the
 * gs_main_run_xxx procedures to push parameters quickly and to get results
 * back.  The push procedures return 0, e_stackoverflow, or e_VMerror;
 * the pop procedures return 0, e_stackunderflow, or e_typecheck.
 *
 * Procedures to push values on the operand stack:

/* ---------------- Debugging ---------------- */

 * and operand and execution stacks in hex.  Clients will probably
 * never call this.
 */

			ref *perror_object);

/* ---------------- Console output ---------------- */

/* ---------------- Termination ---------------- */

/*
 * Terminate the interpreter by closing all devices and releasing all
 * allocated memory.  Currently, because of some technical problems
 * with statically initialized data, it is not possible to reinitialize
 * the interpreter after terminating it; we plan to fix this as soon as
 * possible.
 *
 * Note that calling gs_to_exit (defined in gsexit.h) automatically calls
 * gs_main_finit for the default instance.
