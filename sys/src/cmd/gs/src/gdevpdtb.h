/* ================ Types and structures ================ */

/*
 * A "base font" pdf_base_font_t contains a stable copy of a gs_font.  The
 * only supported font types are Type 1/2, TrueType / Type 42, CIDFontType
 * 0, and CIDFontType 2.
 *
 * At the time a base font is created, we copy the fixed elements of the
 * gs_font (that is, everything except the data for individual glyphs) into
 * stable memory; we then copy individual glyphs as they are used.  If
 * subsetting is not mandatory (that is, if the entire font might be
 * embedded or its Widths written), we also save a separate copy of the
 * entire font, since the subsetting decision cannot be made until the font
 * is written out (normally at the end of the document).
 *
 * In an earlier design, we deferred making the complete copy until the font
 * was about to be freed.  We decided that the substantial extra complexity
 * of this approach did not justify the space that would be saved in the
 * usual (subsetted) case.
 *
 * The term "base font" is used, confusingly, for at least 3 different
 * concepts in Ghostscript.  However, the above meaning is used consistently
 * within the PDF text code (gdevpdt*.[ch]).
 */
/*
 * Font names in PDF files have caused an enormous amount of trouble, so we
 * document specifically how they are handled in each structure.
 *
 * The PDF Reference doesn't place any constraints on the [CID]FontName of
 * base fonts, although it does say that the BaseFont name in the font
 * resource is "usually" derived from the [CID]FontName of the base font.
 * The code in this module allows setting the font name.  It initializes
 * the name to the key_name of the base font, or to the font_name if the
 * base font has no key_name, minus any XXXXXX+ subset prefix; the
 * pdf_do_subset_font procedure adds the XXXXXX+ prefix if the font will
 * be subsetted.
