#include "gdevprn.h"

/*
 * The following is taken from the BJ200 Programmer's manual.  The top
 * margin is 3mm (0.12"), and the bottom margin is 6.4mm (0.25").  The
 * left and right margin depend on the type of paper -- US letter or
 * A4 -- but ultimately rest on a print width of 203.2mm (8").  For letter
 * paper, the left margin (and hence the right) is 6.4mm (0.25"), while
 * for A4 paper, both are 3.4mm (0.13").
 *
 * The bottom margin requires a bit of care.  The image is printed
 * as strips, each about 3.4mm wide.  We can only attain the bottom 
 * margin if the final strip coincides with it.  Note that each strip
 * is generated using only 48 of the available 64 jets, and the absence
 * of those bottom 16 jets makes our bottom margin, in effect, about
 * 1.1mm (0.04") larger.
 *
 * The bj200 behaves, in effect, as though the origin were at the first
 * printable position, rather than the top left corner of the page, so
 * we add a translation to the initial matrix to compensate for this.
 *
 * Except for the details of getting the margins correct, the bj200 is
 * no different from the bj10e, and uses the same routine to print each
 * page.
 *
 * NOTE:  The bj200 has a DIP switch called "Text scale mode" and if
 * set, it allows the printer to get 66 lines on a letter-sized page
 * by reducing the line spacing by a factor of 14/15.  If this DIP
 * switch is set, the page image printed by ghostscript will also be
 * similarly squeezed.  Thus text scale mode is something ghostscript
 * would like to disable.
 *
 * According to the bj200 manual, which describes the bj10 commands,
 * the printer can be reset either to the settings determined by the
 * DIP switches, or to the factory defaults, and then some of those
 * settings can be specifically overriden.  Unfortunately, the text
 * scale mode and horizontal print position (for letter vs A4 paper)
 * can not be overriden.  On my bj200, the factory settings are for
 * no text scaling and letter paper, thus using the factory defaults
 * also implies letter paper.  I don't know if this is necessarily
 * true for bj200's sold elsewhere, or for other printers that use
 * the same command set.
 *
 * If your factory defaults are in fact the same, you can compile
 * the driver with USE_FACTORY_DEFAULTS defined, in which case the
 * printer will be reset to the factory defaults for letter paper,
 * and reset to the DIP switch settings for A4 paper.  In this case,
 * with letter-sized paper, the text scale mode will be disabled.
 * Further, by leaving the horizontal print position DIP switch set
 * for A4 paper, gs will be able to print on either A4 or letter
 * paper without changing the DIP switch.  Since it's not clear that
 * the factory defaults are universal, the default behaviour is not
 * to define USE_FACTORY_DEFAULTS, and the printer will always be
 * reset to the DIP switch defaults.

 * Notes on the BJ10e/BJ200 command set.
 *

According to the BJ200 manual, the "set initial condition" sequence (ESC [
K) has 2 bytes which can override the DIP switches -- these are the last 2
bytes.  Several bits are listed as "reserved" -- one or more may possibly
affect the sheet feeder.  The first is referred to as <P1>, with the
following meaning:
				1		0
bit 7	ignore/process P1	ignore		process
bit 6	reserved
bit 5	alarm			disabled	enabled
bit 4	automatic CR		CR+LF		CR
bit 3	automatic LF		CR+LF		LF
bit 2	page length		12 inches	11 inches
bit 1	style for zero		slashed		not slashed
bit 0	character set		set 2		set 1

The last byte is <P2>, with the following meaning:
				1		0
bit 7	ignore/process P2	ignore		process
bit 6	code page		850		437
bit 5	reserved
bit 4	reserved
bit 3	reserved
bit 2	reserved
bit 1	reserved
bit 0	reserved

The automatic CR setting is important to gs, but the rest shouldn't matter
(gs doesn't print characters or send LF, and it explicitly sets the page
length).  The sequence ESC 5 <n> controls automatic CR -- if <n> is 0x00,
it is turned off (CR only) and if <n> is 0x01, it is turned on (CR + LF).
So we do following: Change the initialization string to so that the last 2
of the 9 bytes are \200 rather than \000.  Then add
	|* Turn off automatic carriage return, otherwise we get line feeds. *|
	fwrite("\0335\000", 1, 3, prn_stream);
after the initialization.  (Actually, instead of setting the last 2 bytes
to \200, we suppress them altogether by changing the byte count from \004
to \002 (the byte count is the 4th (low 8 bits) and 5th (high 8 bits) bytes
in the initialization sequence).)
