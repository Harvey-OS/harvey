/*
  The API defined in this file and implemented in gsimage.c provides a
  layer of buffering between clients and the underlying image processing
  interface defined in gxdevcli.h (begin_[typed_]image device procedure) and
  gxiparam.h (image processing procedures).

  Two of the underlying image processing procedures defined in gxiparam.h
  define and process the actual data:

  - The underlying planes_wanted image processing procedure indicates which
    data planes are needed (not necessarily all of them, in the case of
    images with differently scaled planes), and may also change the widths
    and/or depths of the planes.  It may return different results at
    different times, if the widths, depths, or planes wanted changes in the
    course of the image.

  - The underlying plane_data procedure actually processes the image.  Each
    call of plane_data requires an integral number of scan lines for each
    wanted plane.  If the widths, depths, or planes wanted vary from call to
    call, plane_data may choose to accept fewer scan lines than provided.
    If this happens, it is the client's responsibility to call planes_wanted
    to find out which planes are now wanted, and then call plane_data again
    with data for (only) the wanted planes.

  Conceptually, the gs_image_next_planes procedure defined here provides the
  same function as the plane_data procedure, except that:

  - The data need not consist of complete scan lines, or be aligned in any
    way;

  - If a single call passes multiple scan lines for a single plane, each
    scan line is only padded to a byte boundary, not to an alignment
    boundary;

  - Different amounts of data (including none) may be passed for each plane,
    independent of which planes need data or the amount of data that makes
    up a complete scan line for a plane;

  - The amount actually used is returned as a count of bytes used
    (separately for each plane) rather than a count of scan lines.

  There is one added complication.  To avoid allocating large amounts of
  storage, gs_image_next_planes may choose to copy only part of the data,
  retaining the rest of it by reference.  Clients must be informed about
  this, since if the data is in a stream buffer, the data may move.  To
  accommodate this possibility, on subsequent calls, any data passed by the
  client for a plane with retained data *replaces* the retained data rather
  than (as one might expect) appending to it; if the client passes no data
  for that plane, the retained data stays retained if needed.
  gs_image_next_planes returns information about retained data on each call,
  so the client need not keep track of it.

  The gs_image_planes_wanted procedure is analogous to planes_wanted.  It
  identifies a plane as wanted if both of the following are true:

  - The underlying planes_wanted procedure says the plane is wanted.

  - Less than a full scan line of data is already buffered for that plane
    (including retained data if any).

  This is not sufficient information for the PostScript interpreter for the
  case where the data sources are procedures, which must be called in a
  cyclic order even if they return less than a full scan line.  For this
  case, the interpreter must keep track of a plane index itself, cycling
  through the planes that gs_image_planes_wanted says are wanted (which may
  vary from cycle to cycle).

  There is an older, simpler procedure gs_image_next that simply cycles
  through the planes in order.  It does not offer the option of replacing
  retained data, of passing data for more than one plane at a time, or of
  passing data for planes in an arbitrary order.  Consequently, it is only
  usable with image types where all planes are always wanted.  gs_image_next
  should also only be used when all planes have the same width and depth and
  the same amount of data is passed for each plane in a given cycle of
  calls.  This is not currently checked; however, gs_image_next will give an
  error if an attempt is made to pass data for a plane that has any retained
  data.
