                         The color approximation looks worse than with triangles, and works some
                         slower.

/* When INTERPATCH_PADDING > 0, it generates paddings between patches,
   i.e. performs a patch expansion, being similar
   to the path adjustment in the filling algorithm.
   The expansion is an emulation of Adobe's trapping.
   The value specifies the width of paddings.
   We did some testing of Adobe RIP, and it looks as applying
   same logicks as for clipping - any part of pixel inside.
   Therefore the expansion should be half pixel size.
