/*
 * Most graphics library procedures that process bitmap data (such as, for
 * example, the "device" procedures in gdevm*.c) impose two requirements
 * on such data: an alignment requirement, and a padding requirement.
 * Both requirements arise from the fact that these library procedures
 * attempt to process the bits in units of align_bitmap_mod bytes.
 *
 * The alignment requirement is that each scan line must start at an
 * address that is 0 mod align_bitmap_mod.  This requirement is only for
 * the benefit of the hardware (which may, for example, require that
 * instructions fetching or storing a 'long' quantity only do so at an
 * address that is long-aligned), but it must be respected in all
 * platform-independent code.  More precisely, platform-independent code
 * can *assume* that Ghostscript allocators return blocks that are adequately
 * aligned, and then must *ensure* that that alignment is not lost.  (The
 * assumption is not true in some MSVC implementations, but even in those
 * implementations, the alignment is sufficient to satisfy the hardware.
 * See gsmemraw.h for more information about this.)
 * 
 * The padding requirement is that if the last data byte being operated on
 * is at offset B relative to the start of the scan line, bytes up to and
 * including offset ROUND_UP(B + 1, align_bitmap_mod) - 1 may be accessed,
 * and therefore must be allocated (not cause hardware-level access faults).

/*
 * For halftones at arbitrary angles, we provide for storing the halftone
 * data as a strip that must be shifted in X for different values of Y.  For
 * an ordinary (non-shifted) halftone that has a repetition width of W and a
 * repetition height of H, the pixel at coordinate (X,Y) corresponds to
 * halftone pixel (X mod W, Y mod H), ignoring phase; for a strip halftone
 * with strip shift S and strip height H, the pixel at (X,Y) corresponds to
 * halftone pixel ((X + S * floor(Y/H)) mod W, Y mod H).  In other words,
 * each Y increment of H shifts the strip left by S pixels.
 *
 * As for non-shifted tiles, a strip bitmap may include multiple copies
 * in X or Y to reduce loop overhead.  In this case, we must distinguish:
 *      - The height of an individual strip, which is the same as
 *      the height of the bitmap being replicated (rep_height, H);
 *      - The height of the entire bitmap (size.y).
 * Similarly, we must distinguish:
 *      - The shift per strip (rep_shift, S);
 *      - The shift for the entire bitmap (shift).
 * Note that shift = (rep_shift * size.y / rep_height) mod rep_width,
 * so the shift member of the structure is only an accelerator.  It is,
 * however, an important one, since it indicates whether the overall
 * bitmap requires shifting or not.
 *
 * Note that for shifted tiles, size.y is the size of the stored bitmap
 * (1 or more strips), and NOT the height of the actual tile.  The latter
 * is not stored in the structure at all: it can be computed as H * W /
 * gcd(S, W).
 *
 * If the bitmap consists of a multiple of W / gcd(S, W) copies in Y, the
 * effective shift is zero, reducing it to a tile.  For simplicity, we
 * require that if shift is non-zero, the bitmap height be less than H * W /
 * gcd(S, W).  I.e., we don't allow strip bitmaps that are large enough to
 * include a complete tile but that don't include an integral number of
 * tiles.  Requirements:
 *      rep_shift < rep_width
 *      shift = (rep_shift * (size.y / rep_height)) % rep_width
