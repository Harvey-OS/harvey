/* Pn macros for pre-ANSI compiler compatibility */

#ifndef stdpn_INCLUDED
#define stdpn_INCLUDED

/*
 * We formerly supported "traditional" (pre-ANSI) C compilers, by using
 * these macros for formal parameter lists and defining them as empty
 * for pre-ANSI compilers, with the syntax
 *      resulttype func(Pn(arg1, ..., argn));
 * However, we no longer support pre-ANSI compilers; these macros are
 * deprecated (should not be used in new code), and eventually will be
 * removed.
