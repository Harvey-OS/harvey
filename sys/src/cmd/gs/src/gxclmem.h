	 * by a successful call to memfile_set_memory_warning(N).  Fwrite
	 * allocates memory only from the reserve when its normal allocation
	 * attempts fail; in such cases, it allocates blocks from the
	 * reserve pool as needed and completes normally, but returns a
	 * low-memory warning status. Once a low-memory warning has been
	 * returned, fwrite will continue to attempt to allocate memory from
	 * the usual allocator on subsequent fwrites, but does *not* try to
	 * "top up" the reserve if becomes available -- only an explicit
	 * memfile_set_memory_warning does so.
