#ifndef gdev8bcm_INCLUDED

/*
 * The MS-DOS, MS Windows, and X Windows drivers all use (at least on
 * some platforms) an 8-bit color map in which some fraction is reserved
 * for a pre-allocated cube and some or all of the remainder is
 * allocated dynamically.  Since looking up colors in this map can be
 * a major performance bottleneck, we provide an efficient implementation
 * that can be shared among drivers.
 *
 * As a performance compromise, we only look up the top 5 bits of the
 * RGB value in the color map.  This compromises color quality very little,
 * and allows substantial optimizations.
