####### The following are the only parts of the file you should need to edit.

# ------ Generic options ------ #

# Define the directory for the final executable, and the

# the directories also define the default search path for the
# initialization files (gs_*.ps) and the fonts.

# Define the default directory/ies for the runtime
# initialization and font files.  Separate multiple directories with a ;.

GS_LIB_DEFAULT="$(gsdatadir)/lib;$(gsfontdir)"

# Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always
# look in the current directory first.  This leads to well-known security
# and confusion problems, but users insist on it.
# NOTE: this also affects searching for files named on the command line:
# see the "File searching" section of Use.htm for full details.
# Because of this, setting SEARCH_HERE_FIRST to 0 is not recommended.

SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=1

# Define the name of the interpreter initialization file.
# (There is no reason to change this.)

GS_INIT=gs_init.ps

# Choose generic configuration options.

# -DDEBUG
#	includes debugging features (-Z switch) in the code.
#	  Code runs substantially slower even if no debugging switches
#	  are set.
# -DNOPRIVATE
#	makes private (static) procedures and variables public,
#	  so they are visible to the debugger and profiler.
#	  No execution time or space penalty.

GENOPT=

# Define the name of the executable file.

GS=gs

# Define the name of a pre-built executable that can be invoked at build
# time.  Currently, this is only needed for compiled fonts.  The usual
# alternatives are:
#   - the standard name of Ghostscript on your system (typically `gs'):
BUILD_TIME_GS=gs
#   - the name of the executable you are building now.  If you choose this
# option, then you must build the executable first without compiled fonts,
# and then again with compiled fonts.
#BUILD_TIME_GS=$(BINDIR)/$(GS) -I$(PSLIBDIR)

# Define the directory where the IJG JPEG library sources are stored,
# and the major version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the IJG library version changes.
# See jpeg.mak for more information.

JSRCDIR=jpeg
JVERSION=6

# Choose whether to use a shared version of the IJG JPEG library (-ljpeg).
# DON'T DO THIS. If you do, the resulting executable will not be able to
# read some PostScript files containing JPEG data, because Adobe chose to
# define PostScript's JPEG capabilities in a way that is slightly
# incompatible with the JPEG standard.  See Make.htm for more details.

# DON'T SET THIS TO 1!  See the comment just above.
SHARE_JPEG=0
JPEG_NAME=jpeg

# Define the directory where the PNG library sources are stored,
# and the version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the libpng version changes.
# See libpng.mak for more information.

PSRCDIR=libpng
PVERSION=10005

# Choose whether to use a shared version of the PNG library (-lpng).
# See gs.mak and Make.htm for more information.

SHARE_LIBPNG=0

# Define the directory where the zlib sources are stored.
# See zlib.mak for more information.

# Choose whether to use a shared version of the zlib library (-lgz).
# See gs.mak and Make.htm for more information.

SHARE_ZLIB=0
ZLIB_NAME=gz

# ------ Platform-specific options ------ #

# Define the name of the C compiler.

CC=gcc

# Define the other compilation flags.
# Add -DBSD4_2 for 4.2bsd systems.
# Add -DSYSV for System V or DG/UX.
# Add -DSYSV -D__SVR3 for SCO ODT, ISC Unix 2.2 or before,
#   or any System III Unix, or System V release 3-or-older Unix.
# Add -DSVR4 (not -DSYSV) for System V release 4.
# XCFLAGS can be set from the command line.
# We don't include -ansi, because this gets in the way of the platform-
#   specific stuff that <math.h> typically needs; nevertheless, we expect
#   gcc to accept ANSI-style function prototypes and function definitions.
XCFLAGS=

# Under DJGPP, since we strip the executable by default, we may as
# well *not* use '-g'.

# CFLAGS=-g -O $(XCFLAGS)
CFLAGS=-O $(XCFLAGS)

# Define platform flags for ld.
# Ultrix wants -x.
# SunOS 4.n may need -Bstatic.
# XLDFLAGS can be set from the command line.
XLDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(XLDFLAGS)

# Define any extra libraries to link into the executable.
# ISC Unix 2.2 wants -linet.
# SCO Unix needs -lsocket if you aren't including the X11 driver.
# (Libraries required by individual drivers are handled automatically.)

EXTRALIBS=-lsys -lc

# Define the standard libraries to search at the end of linking.
# All reasonable platforms require -lm, but Rhapsody and perhaps one or
# two others fold libm into libc and require STDLIBS to be empty.

STDLIBS=-lm

# Define the include switch(es) for the X11 header files.
# This can be null if handled in some other way (e.g., the files are
# in /usr/include, or the directory is supplied by an environment variable);
# in particular, SCO Xenix, Unix, and ODT just want
#XINCLUDE=
# Note that x_.h expects to find the header files in $(XINCLUDE)/X11,
# not in $(XINCLUDE).

XINCLUDE=

# Define the directory/ies and library names for the X11 library files.
# The former can be null if these files are in the default linker search path.
# Unfortunately, Quarterdeck's old libraries did not conform to the
# X11 conventions for naming, in that the main Xlib library was called
# libx.a, not libx11.a.  To make things worse, both are provided in
# the v2.00 library.  Creation dates indicate that 'libx.a' is left
# over from a previous build (or this could just be on my system, but
# others who have upgraded from the early version will have the same
# problem---SJT).  Thus I will make the default to look for
# 'libx11.a', since v1.0x does *not* have it and the linker will
# complain.  With the reverse default, the linker will find to the
# obsolete library on some systems.

# XLIBDIRS includes a prefix -L; XLIBDIR does not.

# Define whether this platform has floating point hardware:
#	FPU_TYPE=2 means floating point is faster than fixed point.
# (This is the case on some RISCs with multiple instruction dispatch.)
#	FPU_TYPE=1 means floating point is at worst only slightly slower
# than fixed point.
#	FPU_TYPE=0 means that floating point may be considerably slower.
#	FPU_TYPE=-1 means that floating point is always much slower than
# fixed point.

BAND_LIST_STORAGE=file

# Choose which compression method to use when storing band lists in memory.
