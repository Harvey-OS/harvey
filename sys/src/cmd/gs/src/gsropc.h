 * Define parameters for RasterOp-compositing.
 * There are two kinds of RasterOp compositing operations.
 * If texture == 0, the input data are the texture, and the source is
 * implicitly all 0 (black).  If texture != 0, it defines the texture,
 * and the input data are the source.  Note that in the latter case,
