/*
 * A 'memory' device is essentially a stored bitmap.
 * There are several different kinds: 1-bit black and white,
 * 2-, 4-, and 8-bit mapped color, 16- and 24-bit RGB color,
 * and 32-bit CMYK color.  (16-bit uses 5/6/5 bits per color.)
 * All use the same structure, since it's so awkward to get the effect of
 * subclasses in C.
 *
 * Memory devices come in two flavors: standard, which always stores bytes
 * big-endian, and word-oriented, which stores bytes in the machine order
 * within 32-bit "words".  The source data for copy_mono and
 * copy_color must be in big-endian order, and since memory devices
 * also are guaranteed to allocate the bitmap consecutively,
 * the bitmap of a standard memory device can serve directly as input
 * to copy_mono or copy_color operations.  This is not true of word-oriented
 * memory devices, which are provided only in response to a request by
 * a customer with their own image processing library that uses this format.
 *
 * In addition to the device structure itself, memory devices require two
 * other pieces of storage: the bitmap, and a table of pointers to the scan
 * lines of the bitmap.  Clients have several options for allocating these:
 *
 *	1) Set bitmap_memory to an allocator before opening the device.
 *	With this option, opening the device allocates the bitmap and the
 *	line pointer table (contiguously), and closing the device frees
 *	them.
 *
 *	2) Set line_pointer_memory to an allocator, base to the base address
 *	of the bitmap, and raster to the length of each scan line (distance
 *	from one scan line to the next) before opening the device.  With
 *	this option, opening the device allocates the line table, but not
 *	the bitmap; closing the device frees the table.
 *
 *	3) Set line_pointer_memory but not base or raster.  Opening /
 *	closing the device will allocate / free the line pointer table, but
 *	the client must set the pointers with a subsequent call of
 *	gdev_mem_set_line_ptrs.
 *
 *	4) Set neither _memory field.  In this case, it's up to the client
 *	to call gdev_mem_set_line_ptrs and to manage storage for the
 *	line pointers and the bitmap.
 *
 * In cases (2) through (4), it is the client's responsibility to set
 * foreign_bits (and foreign_line_pointers, if the line pointers are not
 * contiguous with the bits) to tell the GC whether to trace the pointers.
 * By default, anything allocated by bitmap_memory or line_pointer_memory is
 * assumed GC'able (i.e., case (1) assumes that the bits + line pointers are
 * GC'able, and cases (2) and (3) assume that the line pointers are GC'able,
 * but not the bits), but the client can change the foreign_* flag(s) after
 * opening the device if this is not the case.
