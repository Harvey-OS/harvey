 * According to the PostScript language definition, save objects are simple,
 * not composite.  Consequently, we cannot use their natural representation,
 * namely a t_struct pointing to an alloc_save_t, since we aren't willing to
 * allocate them all in global VM and rely on garbage collection to clean
 * them up.  Instead, we assign each one a unique "save ID", and store this
 * in the alloc_save_t object.  Mapping the number to the object requires
 * at most searching the local save chain for the current gs_dual_memory_t,
 * and this approach means we don't have to do anything to invalidate
 * save objects when we do a restore.
