/*
 * A command list is essentially a compressed list of driver calls.
 * Command lists are used to record an image that must be rendered in bands
 * for high-resolution and/or limited-memory printers.
 *
 * Command lists work in two phases.  The first phase records driver calls,
 * sorting them according to the band(s) they affect.  The second phase
 * reads back the commands band-by-band to create the bitmap images.
 * When opened, a command list is in the recording state; it switches
 * automatically from recording to reading when its get_bits procedure
 * is called.  Currently, there is a hack to reopen the device after
 * each page is processed, in order to switch back to recording.
 */

/*
 * The command list contains both commands for particular bands (the vast
 * majority) and commands that apply to a range of bands.  In order to
 * synchronize the two, we maintain the following invariant for buffered
 * commands:
 *
 *      If there are any band-range commands in the buffer, they are the
 *      first commands in the buffer, before any specific-band commands.
 *
 * To maintain this invariant, whenever we are about to put an band-range
 * command in the buffer, we check to see if the buffer already has any
 * band-range commands in it, and if so, whether they are the last commands
 * in the buffer and are for the same range; if the answer to any of these
 * questions is negative, we flush the buffer.

/*
 * Currently, halftoning occurs during the first phase, producing calls
 * to tile_rectangle.  Both phases keep a cache of recently seen bitmaps
 * (halftone cells and characters), which allows writing only a short cache
 * index in the command list rather than the entire bitmap.
 *
 * We keep only a single cache for all bands, but since the second phase
 * reads the command lists for each band separately, we have to keep track
 * for each cache entry E and band B whether the definition of E has been
 * written into B's list.  We do this with a bit mask in each entry.
 *
 * Eventually, we will replace this entire arrangement with one in which
 * we pass the actual halftone screen (whitening order) to all bands
 * through the command list, and halftoning occurs on the second phase.
 * This not only will shrink the command list, but will allow us to apply
 * other rendering algorithms such as error diffusion in the second phase.
