/* This allows an MS-Windows file handle to be passed in to
 * Ghostscript as %handle%NNNNNNNN where NNNNNNNN is the hexadecimal
 * value of the handle.
 * The typical use is for another program to create a pipe,
 * pass the write end into Ghostscript using
 *  -sOutputFile="%handle%NNNNNNNN"
 * so that Ghostscript printer output can be captured by the
 * other program.  The handle would be created with CreatePipe().
 * If Ghostscript is not a DLL, the pipe will have to be inheritable
 * by the Ghostscript process.
