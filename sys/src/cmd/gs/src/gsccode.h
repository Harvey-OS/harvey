/*
 * Define a character glyph code, a.k.a. character name.  The space of
 * glyph codes is divided into five sections:
 *
 *	- Codes >= GS_MIN_GLYPH_INDEX represent (non-negative)
 *	  integers biased by GS_MIN_CID_GLYPH.  They represent glyph indices
 *	  of a specific font.
 *
 *	- Codes within [GS_MIN_CID_GLYPH, GS_MIN_GLYPH_INDEX) represent
 *(non-negative)
 *	  integers biased by GS_MIN_CID_GLYPH.  They represent PostScript CIDs
 *        of a specific Ordering.
 *
 *	- Codes < GS_MIN_CID_GLYPH represent named glyphs.  There are
 *	  three sub-sections:
 *
 *	  - GS_NO_GLYPH, which means "no known glyph value".  Note that
 *	    it is not the same as /.notdef or CID 0 or GID 0: it means
 *	    that the identity of the glyph is unknown, as opposed to a
 *	    known glyph that is used for rendering an unknown character
 *	    code.
 *
 *	  - Codes < gs_c_min_std_encoding_glyph represent names in some
 *	    global space that the graphics library doesn't attempt to
 *	    interpret.  (When the client is the PostScript interpreter,
 *	    these codes are PostScript name indices, but the graphics
 *	    library doesn't know or rely on this.)  The graphics library
 *	    *does* assume that such codes denote the same names across
 *	    all fonts, and that they can be converted to a string name
 *	    by the font's glyph_name virtual procedure.
 *
 *	  - Codes >= gs_c_min_std_encoding_glyph (and < GS_MIN_CID_GLYPH)
 *	    represent names in a special space used for the 11 built-in
 *	    Encodings.  The API is defined in gscencs.h.  The only
 *	    procedures that generate or recognize such codes are the ones
 *	    declared in that file: clients must be careful not to mix
 *	    such codes with codes in the global space.
 *
 * Client code may assume that GS_NO_GLYPH < GS_MIN_CID_GLYPH (i.e., it is a
 * "name", not an integer), but should not make assumptions about whether
 * GS_NO_GLYPH is less than or greater than gs_c_min_std_encoding_glyph.
