/* Client interface to color space substitution */

/*
 * Color space substitution at the library level is similar to, but not
 * identical to, the operation of UseCIEColor in the PostScript language.
 * When the Boolean UseCIEColor parameter of the current device is false,
 * everything operates as normal.  When UseCIEColor is true, the following
 * procedures may substitute another color space for the implied one:
 *
 *	gs_setgray, gs_setrgbcolor, gs_sethsbcolor, gs_setcmykcolor
 *	gs_current_Device{Gray,RGB,CMYK}_space
 *
 * Unlike the PostScript facility, the substitution *is* visible to
 * gs_currentcolorspace, and does *not* affect gs_setcolorspace, or the
 * ColorSpace members of images or shadings.  However, the following
 * procedures recognize when substitution has occurred and return the
 * value(s) appropriate for the pre-substitution space:
 *
 *	gs_currentgray, gs_currentrgbcolor, gs_currenthsbcolor,
 *	  gs_currentcmykcolor
 *
 * Thus gs_{current,set}{gray,{rgb,hsb,cmyk}color} are always mutually
 * consistent, concealing any substitution, and gs_{current,set}{colorspace}
 * are mutually consistent, reflecting any substitution.
 * gs_{current,set}color are consistent with the other color accessors,
 * since color space substitution doesn't affect color values.
 *
 * As in PostScript, color space substitutions are not affected by
 * (ordinary) grestore or by setgstate.  Graphics states created by gsave or
 * gstate, or overwritten by currentgstate or copygstate, share
 * substitutions with the state from which they were copied.
