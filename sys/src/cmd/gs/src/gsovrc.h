/*
 * Overprint compositor.
 *
 * The overprint and overprint mode capability allow drawing operations
 * to affect a subset of the set of color model components, rather than
 * all components. The overprint feature allows the set of affected
 * components to be determined by the color space, but independently of
 * the drawing color. Overprint mode allows both the color space and
 * drawing color to determine which components are affected.
 *
 * The significance of the overprint feature for a device is dependent on
 * the extent of rendering that is to be performed for that device:
 *
 *  1. High level devices, such as the PDFWrite and PSWrite devices,
 *     do not, in principle, require the graphic library to convert
 *     between color spaces and color models. These devices can accept
 *     color space descriptions, so conversion to a color model can be
 *     left to whatever application uses the generated file.
 *
 *     For these devices, overprint and overprint mode are just
 *     additional state parameters that are incorporated into the output
 *     file, which may or may not be supported on the eventual target
 *     application.
 *
 *     Note that the current implementation of PDFWrite and PSWrite
 *     do require the graphic library to convert between color spaces
 *     and a color model, for all objects except images. To implement
 *     the overprint feature under this design, the devices would
 *     have to support the get_bits_rectangle method, which means they
 *     would need to function as low-level devices. Since that defeats
 *     the purpose of having a high-level device, for the time being
 *     overprint and overprint mode are not fully supported for the
 *     PDFWrite and PSWrite devices.
 *
 *  2. Low level devices require the graphic library to convert between
 *     color spaces and color models, and perform actual rendering. For
 *     these devices both overprint and overprint mode require a form
 *     of mixing of the drawing color with any existing output. This
 *     mixing is mechanically similar to that required for transparency
 *     or raster op support, but differs from these because it affects
 *     different color components differently (transparency and raster
 *     operations are applied uniformly to all color components).
 *
 * Because the implementation of overprint for high level devices is
 * either trivial or essentially impossible (short of dealing with them
 * as low level devices), the discussion below is restricted to the
 * implementation for low level devices.
 *
 * In principle, the effects of overprint and overprint mode are
 * modified by changes to the current color, the current color space,
 * and the process color model.
 *
 * In most situation, the process color model cannot be changed without
 * discarding any existing graphic output, so within a given page this
 * affect may be ignored. An exception arises when emulating features
 * such as the "overprint preview" mode of Acrobat 5.0. This mode uses
 * a "fully dynamic" color model: any named color component is consider
 * to exist in the process color model (its conversion to a "real" color
 * is determined by the tint transform function associated with its
 * initial invocation). In this situation, the process color model may
 * "monotonically increase" as a page is processed. Since any such
 * change is associated with a change of color space, we need not be
 * concerned with independent changes in the process color model.
 *
 * For typical graphic operations such as line drawing or area filling,
 * both the current color and the current color space remain constant.
 * Overprint and overprint mode are significant for these operations
 * only if the output page contained data prior to the operation. If
 * this is not the case, overprint is irrelevant, as the initial state
 * of any retained color components, and the state of these components
 * in the drawing color, will be the same.
 *
 * Aside from the devices that generate output, Ghostscript makes use
 * of two additional types of the devices for rendering. Forwarding
 * devices do not generate output of their own; they merely forward
 * rendering commands to a target device. Accumulating devices render
 * output to a special buffer (often part of clipping or a caching
 * operation), which is subsequently sent to the primary output device
 * in a lower-level form.
 *
 * It is conceivable that a forwarding device could be dependent on the
 * overprint feature (e.g.: an "inking" filter to determine how much
 * of each colorant is required in each area of the output), but this
 * is unlikely and, in practice, never seems to arise (in practice,
 * inking filters scan the fully generated output). Hence, we ignore
 * this possibility, and need not be concerned with overprint when
 * installing or removing forwarding devices.
 *
 * Overprint is of interest to accumulating devices only if these
 * devices either begin operation with a non-empty output buffer, or if
 * the current color or color space can change during the lifetime of
 * an instantiation of the device. Most instantiations of accumulating
 * devices live only for the rendering of a single graphic object, for
 * which neither the color or color space can change. There are a few
 * exceptions:
 *
 *  - Though images and shaded fills are single graphic objects, they
 *    involve (potentially) many colors. Conveniently, overprint mode
 *    does not apply to either images or shaded fills, so these cause
 *    no difficulty. For the same reason PatternType 2 patterns do
 *    not cause difficulty, though it is necessary to create/update
 *    the overprint compositor to reflect the colorspace included
 *    in the shading dictionary.
 *
 *  - The gs_pdf14_device, which implements the PDF 1.4 transparency
 *    facilities, is an accumulating device that supports only
 *    the high-level rendering methods (fill_path, etc.). Actual
 *    rendering is done with a separate marking device, an instance
 *    of which is created for each graphic object rendered. The
 *    marking device renders into the output buffer of the
 *    gs_pdf14_device, which contains the results of prior rendering
 *    operations. Thus, overprint is significant to the marking
 *    device. The interaction of transparency and overprint are,
 *    however, more complex than can be captured by a simple
 *    compositor. The gs_pdf14_device and the corresponding device
 *    (will) implement overprint and overprint mode directly. These
 *    devices discard attempts to build an overprint compositor.
 *
 *  - The most essential exception involves colored tiling patterns.
 *    Both the color and color space may change multiple times
 *    during the rendering of a colored pattern. If a colored
 *    pattern is cached, an accurate implementation would require
 *    the cache to included compositor creation instructions.
 *    This is not possible in the current Ghostscript pattern
 *    cache (which has other problems independent of overprint).
 *    The best that can be done is to keep the overprint compositor
 *    current during the caching operation itself. For single level
 *    patterns, this will allow the tile instance to be rendered
 *    accurately, even if the tile does not properly overprint
 *    the output raster.
 *
 * Based on this reasoning, we can limit application of the overprint
 * compositor to a small numer of situations:
 *
 *  1. When the overprint or overprint mode parameter of the current
 *     graphic state is changed (the overprint mode parameter is
 *     ignored if overprint is set to false).
 *
 *  2. When the current color space changes, if overprint is set to true
 *     (the colorspace cannot be relevant if the overprint is false).
 *     There are a few exceptions to this rule for uncolored caches
 *     (user paths, FontType 3 fonts) and anti-alias super-sampling.
 *
 *  3. If the current device color changes, if overprint is true and
 *     overprint mode is 1.
 *
 *  4. If the device in the graphic state is changed, or if this device is
 *     reopened after having been closed (e.g.: due to the action of
 *     put_params), if the overprint parameter is set to true.
 *
 *  5. During grestore or setgstate (because the overprint/overprint
 *     mode parameters might change without the current device changing).
 *
 *  6. When creating the pattern accumulator device, if overprint is
 *     set to true.
 *
 * In PostScript and PDF, a change of the color space always has an
 * associated change of the current color, so it is possible to
 * exclude color space changes from the list above. We do not do this,
 * however, because changes in the color space are usually less frequent
 * than changes in the current color, and the latter are only significant
 * if overprint mode is 1.
 *
 * Unlike the other compositors used by Ghostscript (the alpha-channel
 * compositor and the implemented but not used raster operation
 * compositor), once created, the overprint compositor is made part of the
 * current graphic state, and assumes the lifetime and open/close
 * status of the device to which it is applied. In effect, the device to
 * which the compositor is applied will, for purposes of the graphic
 * state, cease to exist as as independent item. The only way to discard
 * the compositor is to change the current device.
 *
 * Subsequent invocations of create_compositor will not create a new
 * compositor. Rather, they change the parameters of the existing
 * compositor device. The compositor functions with only a small
 * performance penalty if overprint is disabled, so there is no reason
 * to discard the compositor if oveprint is turned off.
 *
 * The compositor device will emulate the open/close state of the device
 * to which it is applied. This is accomplished by forwarding all open
 * and close requests. In addition, the compositor device will check the
 * status of the device to which it is applied after each put_params call,
 * and will change its own status to reflect this status. The underlying
 * device is required to close itself if an invocation of put_params
 * changes in the process color model.
 *
 * NB: It is not possible, without an excessive performance delay, for
 *     the compositor to detect all cases in which the device to which
 *     it is applied may close itself due to an error condition. We
 *     believe this will never cause difficulty in practice, as the
 *     closing of a device is not itself used as an error indication.
