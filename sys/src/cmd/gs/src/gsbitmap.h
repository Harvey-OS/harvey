/*
 * The Ghostscript library stores all bitmaps bit-big-endian (i.e., the 0x80
 * bit of the first byte corresponds to x=0), as a sequence of bytes (i.e.,
 * you can't do word-oriented operations on them if you're on a
 * little-endian platform like the Intel 80x86 or VAX).  The first scan line
 * corresponds to y=0 in whatever coordinate system is relevant.
 *
 * The structures defined here are for APIs that don't impose any alignment
 * restrictions on either the starting address or the raster (distance
 * between scan lines) of bitmap data.  The structures defined in gxbitmap.h
 * do impose alignment restrictions, so that the library can use more
 * efficient algorithms; they are declared with identical contents to the
 * ones defined here, so that one can cast between them under appropriate
 * circumstances (aligned to unaligned is always safe; unaligned to
 * aligned is safe if one knows somehow that the data are actually aligned.)
 *
 * In this file we also provide structures that include depth information.
 * It probably was a design mistake not to include this information in the
 * gx structures as well.
 */

/*
 * Drivers such as the X driver and the command list (band list) driver
 * benefit greatly by being able to cache bitmaps (tiles and characters)
 * and refer to them later.  To help them recognize when a bitmap is the
 * same as one that they have seen before, the core code passes an optional
 * ID with the property that if two bitmaps have the same ID, they are
 * guaranteed to have the same contents.  (The converse is *not* true,
 * however: two bitmaps may have different IDs and still be the same.)

/*
 * In its simplest form, the client bitmap structure does not specify a
 * depth, expecting it to be implicit in the context of use.  In many cases
 * it is possible to guess this by comparing size.x and raster, but of
 * course code should not rely on this.  See also gs_depth_bitmap below.
 * Requirements:
 *      size.x > 0, size.y > 0
 *      If size.y > 1,
 *          raster >= (size.x * depth + 7) / 8

 * There is no "strip" version for client bitmaps, as the strip structure is

 * there is little reason to do so with client bitmaps.
 *
 * For client bitmaps it is not always apparent from context what the intended
 * depth per sample value is. To provide for this, an extended version of the
 * bitmap structure is provided, that handles both variable depth and
 * interleaved color components. This structure is provided in both the
 * normal and tiled version.
 *
 * Extending this line of thinking, one could also add color space information
 * to a client bitmap structure. We have chosen not to do so, because color
 * space is almost always derived from context, and to provide such a feature
 * would involve additional memory-management complexity.
