 * The interpreter allocator can allocate in either local or global VM,
 * and can switch between the two dynamically.  In Level 1 configurations,
 * global VM is the same as local; however, this is *not* currently true in
 * a Level 2 system running in Level 1 mode.  In addition, there is a third
 * VM space, system VM, that exists in both modes and is used for objects
 * that must not be affected by even the outermost save/restore (stack
 * segments and names).
 *
 * NOTE: since the interpreter's (only) instances of gs_dual_memory_t are
 * embedded in-line in context state structures, pointers to these
 * instances must not be stored anywhere that might persist across a
 * garbage collection.
