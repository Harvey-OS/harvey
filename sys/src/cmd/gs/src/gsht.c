/*
 * Install a device halftone into the imager state.
 *
 * To allow halftones to be shared between graphic states, the imager
 * state contains a pointer to a device halftone structure. Thus, when 
 * we say a halftone is "in" the imager state, we are only claiming 
 * that the halftone pointer in the imager state points to that halftone.
 *
 * Though the operand halftone uses the same structure as the halftone
 * "in" the imager state, not all of its fields are filled in, and the
 * organization of components differs. Specifically, the following fields
 * are not filled in:
 *
 *  rc          The operand device halftone has only a transient existence,
 *              its reference count information is not initialized. In many
 *              cases, the operand device halftone structure is allocated
 *              on the stack by clients.
 *
 *  id          A halftone is not considered to have an identity until it
 *              is installed in the imager state. This is a design error
 *              which reflects the PostScript origins of this code. In
 *              PostScript, it is impossible to check if two halftone
 *              specifications (sets of operands to setscreen/setcolorscreen
 *              or halftone dictionaries) are the same. Hence, the only way
 *              a halftone could be identified was by the graphic state in
 *              which it was included. In PCL it is possible to directly
 *              identify a halftone specification, but currently there is
 *              no way to use this knowledge in the graphic library.
 *
 *              (An altogether more reasonable approach would be to apply
 *              id's to halftone orders.)
 *
 *  type        This is filled in by the type operand. It is used by
 *              PostScript's currentscreen/currentcolorscreen operators to
 *              determine if a sampling procedure or a halftone dictionary
 *              should be pushed onto the stack. More importantly, it is
 *              also used to determine if specific halftone components can
 *              be used for either the additive or subtractive version of
 *              that component in the process color model. For example, a
 *              RedThreshold in a HalftoneType 4 dictionary can be applied
 *              to either the component "Red" or the component "Cyan", but
 *              the value of the key "Red" in a HalftoneType 5 dictionary
 *              can only be used for a "Red" component (not a "Cyan"
 *              component).
 *
 *  num_comp    For the operand halftone, this is the number of halftone
 *              components included in the specification. For the device
 *              halftone in the imager state, this is always the same as
 *              the number of color model components (see num_dev_comp).
 *
 *  num_dev_comp The number of components in the device process color model
 *		when the operand halftone was created.  With some compositor
 *		devices (for example PDF 1.4) we can have differences in the
 *		process color model of the compositor versus the output device.
 *		These compositor devices do not halftone.
 *
 *  components  For the operand halftone, this field is non-null only if
 *              multiple halftones are provided. In that case, the size
 *              of the array pointed is the same as the number of
 *              components provided. One of these components will usually
 *              be the same as that identified by the "order" field.
 *
 *              For the device halftone in the imager state, this field is
 *              always non-null, and the size of the array pointed to will
 *              be the same as the number of components in the process
 *              color model.
 *
 *  lcm_width,  These fields provide the least common multiple of the
 *  lcm_height  halftone dimensions of the individual component orders.
 *              They represent the dimensions of the smallest tile that
 *              repeats for all color components (this is of interest
 *              because Ghostscript uses a "chunky" raster format for all
 *              drawing procedures). These fields cannot be set in the
 *              operand device halftone as we do not yet know which of
 *              the halftone components will actually be used.
 *
 * Conversely, the "order" field is significant only in the operand device
 * halftone. There it represents the default halftone component, which will
 * be used for all device color components for which a named halftone is
 * not available. It is ignored (filled with 0's) in the device halftone
 * in the imager state.
 *
 * The ordering of entries and the set of fields initialized in the
 * components array also vary between the operand device halftone and
 * the device halftone in the imager state.
 *
 * If the components array is present in the operand device halftone, the
 * cname field in each entry of the array will contain a name index
 * identifying the colorant name, and the comp_number field will provide the
 * index of the corresponding component in the process color model. The
 * order of entries in the components array is essentially arbitrary,
 * but in some common cases will reflect the order in which the halftone
 * specification is provided. By convention, if no explicit default order
 * is provided (i.e.: via a HalftoneType 5 dictionary), the first
 * entry of the array will be the same as the "order" (default) field.
 *
 * For the device halftone in the imager state, the components array is
 * always present, but the cname and comp_number fields of individual
 * entries are ignored. The order of the entries in the array always
 * matches the order of components in the device color model.
 *
 * The distinction between the operand device halftone and the one in
 * the graphic state extends even to the individual fields of the
 * gx_ht_order structure incorporated in the order field of the halftone
 * and the corder field of the elements of the components array. The
 * fields of this structure that are handled differently in the operand 
 * and imager state device halftones are:
 *
 *  params          Provides a set of parameters that are required for
 *                  converting a halftone specification to a single
 *                  component order. This field is used only in the
 *                  operand device halftone; it is not set in the device
 *                  halftone in the imager state.
 *
 *  wse            Points to an "enumerator" instance, used to construct
 *                 a well-tempered screen. This is only required while
 *                 the well-tempered screen is being constructed. This
 *                 field is always a null pointer in the device halftone
 *                 in the imager state.
 *
 *  wts            Points to the "constructed" form of a well-tempered
 *                 screen. The "construction" operation occurs as part
 *                 of the installation process. Hence, this should
 *                 always be a null pointer in the operand device
 *                 halftone.
 *
 *  orig_height,   The height and shift values of the halftone cell,
 *  orig_shift     prior to any replication. These fields are currently
 *                 unused, and will always be the same as the height
 *                 and width fields in the device halftone in the
 *                 imager state.
 *
 *  full_height    The height of the smallest replicated tile whose shift
 *                 value is 0. This is calculated as part of the
 *                 installation process; it may be set in the operand
 *                 device halftone, but its value is ignored.
 *
 *  
 *  data_memory    Points to the memory structure used to allocate the
 *                 levels and bit_data arrays. The handling of this field
 *                 is a bit complicated. For orders that are "taken over"
 *                 by the installation process, this field will have the
 *                 same value in the operand device halftone and the
 *                 device halftone in the imager state. For halftones
 *                 that are copied by the installation process, this
 *                 field will have the same value as the memory field in
 *                 the imager state (the two are usually the same).
 *
 *  cache          Pointer to a cache of tiles representing various
 *                 levels of the halftone. This may or may not be
 *                 provided in the operand device halftone (in principle
 *                 this should always be a null pointer in the operand
 *                 device halftone, but this is not the manner in which
 *                 the cache was handled historically).
 *
 *  screen_params  This structure contains transformation information
 *                 that is required when reading the sample data for a
 *                 screen. It is no longer required once the halftone
 *                 order has been constructed.
 *
 * In addition to what is noted above, this procedure is made somewhat
 * more complex than expected due to memory management considerations. To
 * clarify this, it is necessary to consider the properties of the pieces
 * that constitute a device halftone.
 *
 *  The gx_device_halftone structure itself is shareable and uses
 *  reference counts.
 *
 *  The gx_ht_order_component array (components array entry) is in
 *  principle shareable, though it does not provide any reference
 *  counting mechanism. Hence any sharing needs to be done with
 *  caution.
 *
 *  Individual component orders are not shareable, as they are part of
 *  the gx_ht_order_commponent structure (a major design error).
 *
 *  The levels, bit_data, and cache structures referenced by the
 *  gx_ht_order structure are in principle shareable, but they also do
 *  not provide any reference counting mechanism. Traditionally, one set
 *  of two component orders could share these structures, using the
 *  halftone's "order" field and various scattered bits of special case
 *  code. This practice has been ended because it did not extend to
 *  sharing amongst more than two components.
 *
 *  The gx_transfer_map structure referenced by the gx_ht_order structure
 *  is shareable, and uses reference counts. Traditionally this structure
 *  was not shared, but this is no longer the case.
 *
 * As noted, the rc field of the operand halftone is not initialized, so
 * this procedure cannot simply take ownership of the operand device
 * halftone structure (i.e.: an ostensibly shareable structure is not
 * shareable). Hence, this procedure will always create a new copy of the
 * gx_device_halftone structure, either by allocating a new structure or
 * re-using the structure already referenced by the imager state. This
 * feature must be retained, as in several cases the calling code will
 * allocate the operand device halftone structure on the stack.
 *
 * Traditionally, this procedure took ownership of all of the structures
 * referenced by the operand device halftone structure. This implied
 * that all structures referenced by the gx_device_halftone structure
 * needed to be allocated on the heap, and should not be released once
 * the call to gx_imager_dev_ht_install completes.
 *
 * There were two problems with this approach:
 *
 *  1. In the event of an error, the calling code most likely would have
 *     to release referenced components, as the imager state had not yet
 *     take ownership of them. In many cases, the code did not do this.
 *
 *  2. When the structures referenced by a single order needed to be
 *     shared amongst more than one component, there was no easy way to
 *     discover this sharing when the imager state's device halftone
 *     subsequently needed to be released. Hence, objects would be
 *     released multiple times.
 *
 * Subsequently, the code in this routine was changed to copy most of
 * the referenced structures (everything except the transfer functions).
 * Unfortunately, the calling code was not changed, which caused memory
 * leaks.
 *
 * The approach now taken uses a mixture of the two approaches.
 * Ownership to structures referenced by the operand device halftone is
 * assumed by the device halftone in the imager state where this is
 * possible. In these cases, the corresponding references are removed in
 * the operand device halftone (hence, this operand is no longer
 * qualified as const). When a structure is required but ownership cannot
 * be assumed, a copy is made and the reference in the operand device
 * halftone is left undisturbed. The calling code has also been modified
 * to release any remaining referenced structures when this routine
 * returns, whether or not an error is indicated.
