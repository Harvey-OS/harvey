The following projects are in a partially completed state:

<ul>

<li>CID-keyed fonts in the PDF writer (gdevpdf[eftw].c) -- barely started.

</ul>

<pre>

<h2><a name="6.24_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Procedures)
	- The -Zv and -ZV switches now trace alpha/transparency features.
	- The program name is now AFPL Ghostscript rather than Aladdin
Ghostscript.
	- The default Windows installation directory is now c:\gs rather
than c:\Aladdin.
(Utilities)
	- lib/pdfeof.ps is deleted; its functionality is included in the
standard code.
(Drivers)
	- The X driver now implements sync_output using XSync(False) rather
than XFlush().
(Library)
	- gdev_vector_dopath now never returns 1.
	- Color space types now have a new, required, "equal" procedure.


<h2><a name="6.32 Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- An isolated ampersand needed to be converted to the HTML form.
(doc/Bug-form.htm [1.12]: 2000/11/04 17:53:57 lpd)
	- cvs2hist was generating invalid anchor names and not escaping
special charaters. also enable '-r' commandline option, and pass '-b' if
it's not specified for default branch logs only. Changes.htm now passes the
validator. Minor url cleanup in Release.htm (doc/Changes.htm [1.19],
doc/Release.htm [1.23]: 2000/11/10 01:52:35 giles)
	- Removes obsolete documentation reference to -DUsePrinterImages and
clarifies the entry for the replacing -DPrinted. Fixes sourceforge bug #
121907. (doc/Use.htm [1.16]: 2000/11/20 20:34:23 giles)
	- Removes obsolete documentation reference to -DUsePrinterImages and
clarifies the entry for the replacing -DPrinted. Corresponds to revision
1.16 in the main branch. Fixes sourceforge bug # 121907.
(doc/Use.htm [1.13.2.3]: 2000/11/20 20:39:10 giles)
	- Type 1 CharStrings loaded from disk for type 0 CIDFonts were never
freed, except by garbage collection (which doesn't reclaim chunks with only
a small amount of surviving data). In practice, this probably only affects
the PDF writer. (doc/News.htm [1.71]: 2000/11/23 23:34:23 lpd)

Switches the rest of the human-maintained html documentation to the new
stylesheet. We now pass validator.w3.org for HTML 4.01 with the exception of
an error I couldn't figure out in Bug-form.htm. (doc/Bug-form.htm [1.11],

updated News.htm to use gs.css (doc/News.htm [1.70]: 2000/11/04 21:59:35
giles)

Adds documentation on Ghostscript's object-oriented coding conventions, and
more documentation on error generation. (doc/C-style.htm [1.7],
doc/Develop.htm [1.19]: 2000/11/07 07:34:57 lpd)

Expands the description of the color mapping process.
(doc/Develop.htm [1.20]: 2000/11/09 05:41:46 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.32 Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- WMode was generally ignored in handling the metrics when rendering
a Type 1 or Type 2 CharString; also, the default metrics for WMode = 1 were
the same as the default metrics for WMode = 0, whereas (at least for
CID-keyed fonts) they should be computed from the FontBBox. (fix from
igor@artifex.com) (int.mak [1.37.2.2], lib.mak [1.36.2.1]: 2000/11/09
21:56:58 rayjj)
	- cvs2hist was generating invalid anchor names and not escaping
special charaters. also enable '-r' commandline option, and pass '-b' if
it's not specified for default branch logs only. Changes.htm now passes the
validator. Minor url cleanup in Release.htm (toolbin/cvs2hist.py [1.4]:
2000/11/10 01:52:35 giles)

Collect some stray configuration related externs into iconf.h
(int.mak [1.40]: 2000/11/04 06:12:02 rayjj)

Adds DSC parsing capability to the PostScript interpreter, with an optional
'feature' to use the DSC Orientation comments to compensate for sloppy
PostScript producers that don't emit an appropriate setpagedevice command.
(int.mak [1.41]: 2000/11/05 18:33:53 lpd)

Adds the 'hook' for passing DSC comments to the PDF writer, but doesn't
actually process any of the comments. NOTE: Part of this code was
accidentally included in the recent fix for local/global VM problems in the
PostScript code for using the DSC parser. (devs.mak [1.36]: 2000/11/07
18:54:26 lpd)

Collect some stray configuration related externs into iconf.h
(int.mak [1.37.2.3]: 2000/11/09 22:39:35 rayjj)

Adds DSC parsing capability to the PostScript interpreter, with an optional
'feature' to use the DSC Orientation comments to compensate for sloppy
PostScript producers that don't emit an appropriate setpagedevice command.
(int.mak [1.37.2.4]: 2000/11/09 23:53:36 rayjj)

Reorganizes some text-writing code in anticipation of adding CIDFont and
CMap support. (devs.mak [1.37]: 2000/11/17 22:11:44 lpd)

Avoids exporting empty LD_RUN_PATH environment variable to the link process.
This was causing binaries to search the current directory for libraries,
which was a security hole. Fixes SourceForge bug 122532.
(ugcclib.mak [1.5.2.1], unixlink.mak [1.2.2.1]: 2000/11/28 00:14:34 raph)

Avoids exporting empty LD_RUN_PATH environment variable to the link process.
This was causing binaries to search the current directory for libraries,
which was a security hole. Fixes SourceForge bug 122532. (ugcclib.mak [1.6],
unixlink.mak [1.3]: 2000/11/28 00:14:48 raph)

(version.mak [1.22.2.2]: 2000/11/28 01:31:27 raph)

</pre><h2><a name="6.32 Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- A { } was omitted around an arm of a conditional, causing a
compilation error. (fix by ghost@aladdin.com corresponds to rev. 1.5)
(gp_vms.c [1.4.2.1]: 2000/11/09 21:13:04 rayjj)
	- The simple platform benchmarking program had gotten out of date,
and would no longer compile and link. (fix by ghost@aladdin.com corresponds
to rev. 1.4) (bench.c [1.3.2.1]: 2000/11/10 00:04:02 rayjj)

Removes some old embryonic DSC parser code, since a complete third-party DSC
parser is nearly ready for use. (corresponds to rev 1.2 action by
ghost@aladdin.com) (gsdsc.c [1.1.2.1]: 2000/11/09 23:41:28 rayjj)

</pre><h2><a name="6.32 Drivers"></a>Drivers</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- The margin settings for the Color LaserJet were incorrect. (fix
from henrys@artifex.com) (gdevcljc.c [1.2.2.1]: 2000/11/09 20:31:45 rayjj)
	- PDF patterns and masks could be compressed with the DCT filter,
causing possible color distortion and loss of detail. (fix by
ghost@aladdin.com) (gdevpsdf.h [1.8.2.1], gdevpsdi.c [1.12.2.1]: 2000/11/09
23:24:18 rayjj)
	- In PDF output, color values of 1.0 were usually written as 0.999.
(bug introduced in version 6.22) (gdevpsdu.c [1.8]: 2000/11/12 07:13:26 lpd)

	- Indirect area for StripByteCounts and StripOffsets was put in file
even if there was only one strip so the value was direct.
(gdevtifs.c [1.3.2.1]: 2000/11/16 01:39:55 rayjj)

</pre><h2><a name="6.32 PDF writer"></a>PDF writer</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- kshow caused the PDF writer to revert to bitmapped fonts. Fixes
SourceForge bug # 104118. (gdevpdft.c [1.21]: 2000/11/06 04:17:14 lpd)
	- Writing a Function with subfunctions (Functions array) could
produce garbage output, because the subfunctions could be freed before the
containing Function was written. (fix by ghost@aladdin.com corresponds to
rev. 1.22) (gdevpdf.c [1.21.2.1]: 2000/11/09 20:34:17 rayjj)
	- The PDF writer could write embedded Type 1 fonts with lenIV = -1,
which Acrobat Reader 3 accepts but Acrobat Reader 4 doesn't. (fix by
ghost@aladdin.com) (gdevpdfe.c [1.4.2.1]: 2000/11/09 20:37:29 rayjj)
	- Incrementally downloaded Type 1 fonts weren't embedded properly in
PDF output. (This might have been the case for some TrueType fonts as well,
although we never observed it.) 9fix by ghost@aladdin.com corresponds to
rev. 1.9) (gdevpdff.c [1.8.2.1]: 2000/11/09 20:40:29 rayjj)
	- The algorithm for reducing the resolution of PDF output to deal
with Acrobat Reader's 32K limit on user space coordinates was too
conservative (reduced the resolution more than necessary). (fix by

2000/11/09 23:19:36 rayjj)

	- The PDF writer didn't handle stroked fonts correctly (they were
filled instead of stroked). (gdevpdf.c [1.23], gdevpdfd.c [1.11],
gdevpdft.c [1.22], gdevpdfx.h [1.23]: 2000/11/12 06:52:08 lpd)
	- When mixing filled and stroked fonts, the color wasn't set
correctly. (gdevpdft.c [1.23]: 2000/11/12 07:14:30 lpd)
	- The PDF writer incorrectly assumed that in PDF 1.3, the standard
Latin character set was the PostScript 3 extended set (it's actually the old
PostScript Level 2 set). (gdevpdft.c [1.28]: 2000/11/20 18:13:55 lpd)

Adds the 'hook' for passing DSC comments to the PDF writer, but doesn't
actually process any of the comments. NOTE: Part of this code was
accidentally included in the recent fix for local/global VM problems in the

(change by ghost@aladdin.com corresponds to rev 1.11)
(gdevpdfp.c [1.10.2.1]: 2000/11/09 23:17:37 rayjj)

Fixes problems:
	- The PostScript image writing drivers (psmono/gray/rgb) didn't set
the page size in the output, and didn't produce DSC-compliant output.
(devs.mak [1.31]: 2000/08/09 06:55:45 lpd)
	- The FlateEncode and zlibEncode filters didn't implement the
"Effort" parameter. (fix from Alex Cherepanov) (int.mak [1.28]: 2000/08/09
16:55:24 lpd)
	- Because "-" as an OutputFile now references the %stdout IODevice,
it no longer worked in configurations without a PostScript interpreter.
Fixing this required factoring out the stdin/out/err IODevices and providing
an implementation that didn't reference the PostScript interpreter.
(int.mak [1.32], lib.mak [1.34], ugcclib.mak [1.3]: 2000/09/07 06:14:45 lpd)
	- Configurations including PDF but not PostScript didn't include all
the PostScript LL3 features needed to interpret PDF 1.3 et seq.
(int.mak [1.33]: 2000/09/07 06:35:06 lpd)
	- Cleans up some missing and incorrect dependencies.
(devs.mak [1.33], int.mak [1.34], lib.mak [1.35]: 2000/09/11 04:43:09 lpd)
	- The definition of PSRCDIR was inconsistent with the definition of
PVERSION. (openvms.mak [1.5]: 2000/09/22 04:05:40 lpd)
	- The pgnm and pnm drivers didn't properly detect the presence of
gray shades or color in images, sometimes causing gray or color information
to be lost in the output. (fix contributed by a user) (devs.mak [1.35]:

module uses 4 element X/Y/width/Height, not a gs_rect so xywh_param is a

</pre><h2><a name="6.30 Streams"></a>Streams</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- s_add_filter used min_out_size rather than min_in_size for the
minimum buffer size, which could cause an endless loop when writing to the
filter. (This only affected filters allocated by C code, not by the
PostScript filter operator.) (stream.c [1.7], stream.h [1.6]: 2000/08/16

Fixes problems:
	- Parameter lists didn't have proper GC descriptors; garbage
collection could mangle keys and collection values in non-transient
parameter lists (such as distiller parameters). (gscparam.c [1.5]:
2000/08/19 03:01:30 lpd)
	- gdev_vector_dopath could return 1, which value was then propagated
to callers that interpreted it differently. (gdevvec.c [1.5],
gdevvec.h [1.3]: 2000/08/20 00:21:42 lpd)
	- An AIX compiler could get confused if the last elements of a
structure were individual bytes. (gzpath.h [1.2]: 2000/08/24 19:43:48 lpd)
	- If the OutputFile of a high-level device was ever set, any
subsequent execution of setpagedevice would cause a rangecheck in
.installpagedevice. (gdevvec.c [1.6]: 2000/08/31 02:04:50 lpd)
	- Type 2 CharStrings didn't insert an explicit closepath at the end
of each subpath. (This matters for charpath followed by stroke.)
(gstype2.c [1.5]: 2000/08/31 02:16:45 lpd)
	- Type 2 fonts should insert an explicit closepath only if the
font's PaintType != 1. (gstype2.c [1.6]: 2000/08/31 03:21:45 lpd)
	- The BeOS C compiler objected to some int/bool mismatches.
(gp.h [1.4], gxfill.c [1.4], gxtext.h [1.2]: 2000/08/31 03:51:29 lpd)
	- Because "-" as an OutputFile now references the %stdout IODevice,
it no longer worked in configurations without a PostScript interpreter.
Fixing this required factoring out the stdin/out/err IODevices and providing
an implementation that didn't reference the PostScript interpreter.
(gsiodevs.c [1.1], gslib.c [1.2]: 2000/09/07 06:14:45 lpd)
	- Fixes a type error caused by a change in the TransferFunction
member of gs_transparency_mask_params_t. (gstrans.c [1.7]: 2000/09/10
18:20:09 lpd)
	- Several places in the code for ImageType 3x (soft-masked) images
didn't correctly handle the case where only one of the two masks was
supplied (which is always the case for PDF). (gximag3x.c [1.4]: 2000/09/11
02:12:19 lpd)
	- The -Zv tracing messages for gs_begin_transparency_{group,mask}
were incorrect. (gstrans.c [1.10]: 2000/09/12 20:35:05 lpd)
	- Printing the program name and version didn't use fprintf, so it
didn't work properly with the stdout redirection on Windows. (fix from
Artifex) (gsmisc.c [1.7]: 2000/09/18 06:22:35 lpd)
	- Undefined characters in CID-keyed (FMapType 9) composite fonts
caused an infinite loop, because the parsing index was never advanced past
the character. (gsfcmap.c [1.7]: 2000/09/21 02:44:44 lpd)
	- CID-keyed (FMapType 9) composite fonts didn't return the correct
parsed character code, possibly causing widthshow or cshow to produce
incorrect output. (gsfcmap.c [1.8], gsfcmap.h [1.4]: 2000/09/21 03:02:03
lpd)
	- Works around ANSI C's unreasonable new aliasing restrictions.
(gsnogc.c [1.5]: 2000/09/22 04:17:52 lpd)
	- The 'head' table in embedded TrueType fonts had a length of 56; it
should have a length of 54 and be followed by 2 padding bytes.

Changes the band list representation of mask images to allow
BitsPerComponent > 1 (for soft masks). (gximage1.c [1.2]: 2000/08/24
17:58:18 lpd)

Adds Matte and has_Matte members to ImageType 1 images. These are only used
with the new transparency features. (gsiparam.h [1.2], gximage1.c [1.3]:
2000/08/24 19:20:12 lpd)

Partly implements opacity and shape mask bookkeeping. gsave/grestore/etc.

gxclpath.h [1.4]: 2000/08/25 01:46:48 lpd)

Changes remove_range_from_freelist to only scan relevant freelists, rather
than all of them. On some files, the speedup is dramatic. (gsalloc.c [1.6]:
2000/08/26 01:18:33 lpd)

Completes an edit that accidentally left the repository in an inconsistent
state. (gxclpath.c [1.6], gxclrast.c [1.6]: 2000/08/26 03:19:56 lpd)

Implements some minor improvements to the freelist algorithms that can
produce nearly a factor of 2 speedup in some allocation-intensive
situations. (gsalloc.c [1.7], gxalloc.h [1.4]: 2000/08/26 03:21:34 lpd)

Finishes the code for parsing ImageType 103 (soft-mask) images.
(gximag3x.c [1.2]: 2000/08/30 04:29:56 lpd)

Completes the parsing of .{begin,end}transparency{group,mask}, except for
the TransferFunction for masks. The specification is still subject to
change. (gstparam.h [1.4], gstrans.c [1.4], gstrans.h [1.4]: 2000/08/30

Adds documentation on proposed driver interface additions for managing the

Adds color space type names for tracing/debugging. (gscspace.h [1.4]:

Changes the -Zv switch to trace alpha/transparency-related features.
(gdevabuf.c [1.2]: 2000/09/10 05:23:10 lpd)

Implements another chunk of the PDF 1.4 transparency features, fixing some
bugs in the previous code. (gstparam.h [1.5], gstrans.c [1.6],
gximag3x.c [1.3]: 2000/09/10 05:26:27 lpd)

Moves the Matte entry of soft mask images from the main structure to the
mask structures, and changes Matted to has_Matte. (gsipar3x.h [1.2],
gximag3x.c [1.5], gximag3x.h [1.2]: 2000/09/11 04:08:13 lpd)

Adds a default implementation of soft-masked images that simply ignores the
mask. (gximag3x.c [1.6]: 2000/09/11 04:38:01 lpd)

Upgrades the proposed driver interface transparency extension from comments
to macros, changing the name 'discard_transparency_level' to
'discard_transparency_layer'. (gstrans.c [1.8], gstrans.h [1.5]: 2000/09/11
20:13:31 lpd)

Finishes the (dummy) implementation of the transparency layer stack in the
graphics library. (gsistate.c [1.3], gsstate.c [1.4], gstparam.h [1.6],
gstrans.c [1.9], gxistate.h [1.5]: 2000/09/11 22:20:05 lpd)

<h2><a name="6.23_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Drivers)
	- With high-level drivers ([e]pswrite, pdfwrite, pxl*, cgm*),
changing the OutputFile after writing one or more pages now causes an error.
(Interpreter)
	- By default, copydevice will only copy a device prototype.
	- Some internal references to contexts in zcontext.c are changed
from direct pointers to context indices.
	- Renames internal types to add a _t: ctx_list, ctx_status,
gs_context, gs_condition, gs_lock.
(Library)
	- By default, gs_copydevice[2] will only copy a device prototype.


<h2><a name="6.23 Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Local GC in a multi-context system caused a crash. Also updates
all the internal type names in zcontext.c by adding a _t suffix if
necessary. (doc/News.htm [1.54]: 2000/07/10 23:56:55 lpd)
	- With some high-level drivers, changing the OutputFile after
opening the device could cause a crash. After the fix, doing this works
properly if no pages have actually been written out, but causes a rangecheck
error if any pages have been written. (This is required to maintain internal
consistency.) (doc/News.htm [1.55]: 2000/07/12 14:02:03 lpd)
	- The documented limit on the length of a file name was incorrect.
(doc/Language.htm [1.9]: 2000/08/03 06:45:25 lpd)

Increments the version number, in preparation for the next fileset.
(doc/News.htm [1.52]: 2000/07/06 02:45:06 lpd)

Adds a finish_copydevice device procedure, for cleaning up after copying the
bits of a device prototype or instance. For safety, the default
implementation only allows copying the prototype, not instances. This is a
NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change; however, using copydevice on a device
instance never worked reliably, so it should not have been used this way
before. (doc/Drivers.htm [1.4], doc/News.htm [1.53]: 2000/07/06 04:13:24
lpd)

Updates the references to the Computer Modern Fontmap on CTAN.
(doc/Fonts.htm [1.5], doc/New-user.htm [1.8]: 2000/07/09 23:29:25 lpd)

Updates a couple of release procedures. (doc/Release.htm [1.15]: 2000/07/10
19:32:59 lpd)

Adds documentation and a script for preparing GNU releases from Aladdin
releases. (doc/Release.htm [1.16]: 2000/07/17 17:10:57 lpd)

Clarifies that device parameters set with -d or -s can be changed
subsequently. (doc/Use.htm [1.8]: 2000/07/17 20:13:03 lpd)

Adds a project for making Ghostscript work as a Netscape browser plug-in.
(doc/Projects.htm [1.13]: 2000/07/19 22:50:18 lpd)

Removes the SVG driver from the list of projects, since there is a group
close to completing one (referenced from the Ghostscript home page on the
Web). (doc/Projects.htm [1.14]: 2000/07/20 14:49:52 lpd)

Directs users to the Ghostscript home page on the Web for information about
third-party drivers. (doc/New-user.htm [1.9]: 2000/07/20 14:50:34 lpd)

Adds a partially implemented driver that just produces a trace of its
drawing calls. This driver also serves as a minimal example of how to
implement the high-level driver operations. (doc/Drivers.htm [1.5]:
2000/07/29 04:00:00 lpd)

Fixes problems:
	- $(GLGEN)/md5.h wasn't deleted after compilation. (lib.mak [1.26]:
2000/07/09 23:19:59 lpd)
	- TrueType font loading now requires the Adobe glyph list, but this
dependency was missing from the makefile. (int.mak [1.26]: 2000/07/19
08:11:15 lpd)
	- During compilation, GLSRCDIR was searched before GLGENDIR. (We're
very surprised that this didn't cause detectable trouble before.)
(lib.mak [1.27]: 2000/07/19 14:32:00 lpd)
	- The dependency on gsparamx.$(OBJ) was incorrectly attached to
pdfwrite.dev rather than psdf.dev. (devs.mak [1.30]: 2000/08/03 17:42:52
lpd)
	- 'pre' didn't work with dates in August or September (Tcl doesn't
accept 08 and 09 as valid numbers). (toolbin/pre [1.5]: 2000/08/07 17:35:27
lpd)

Increments the version number, in preparation for the next fileset.
(version.mak [1.17]: 2000/07/06 02:45:06 lpd)

Adds some user-contributed comments about using the Canon BJ200 driver with
the BJ300. (contrib.mak [1.18]: 2000/07/11 15:33:19 lpd)

Updates the (user-contributed) all-architecture build script to work around
a detail in the SGI IRIX C library header files. (all-arch.mak [1.4]:
2000/07/15 19:23:45 lpd)

Adds documentation and a script for preparing GNU releases from Aladdin
releases. (toolbin/makegnu.tcl [1.1]: 2000/07/17 17:10:57 lpd)

Adds a partially implemented driver that just produces a trace of its
drawing calls. This driver also serves as a minimal example of how to
implement the high-level driver operations. (lib.mak [1.28]: 2000/07/29
04:00:00 lpd)

Changes 'gsmake' to report line number rather than character position for
errors and warnings. (toolbin/gsmake.tcl [1.3]: 2000/08/07 17:22:27 lpd)

Updates dates and version #s for the 6.23 fileset. (version.mak [1.18]:

alphabetic fonts explicitly as a TrueType font (e.g., /BaseFont
/TimesNewRoman /Subtype /TrueType) without embedding it, the substituted
Type 1 font had the wrong Encoding. (lib/pdf_font.ps [1.10]: 2000/07/10

<pre>

<h2><a name="6.22_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Procedures)
	- Versions now have odd numbers during development, even numbers
when released.
	- The TMPDIR environment variable, if set, now takes precedence
over TEMP.
	- On MS-DOS, MS Windows, and OS/2 platforms, the batch files that
invoke Ghostscript now use a default name of gswin32 or gswin32c rather than
simply gs.
(Drivers)
	- The PCL drivers now select a given paper size if the requested
height is at least 0.1" greater than the height of the next smaller paper
size, rather than if the requested height is at least as large as that of
the given paper size.
(Interpreter)
	- user_names_p and system_names_p may now be NULL: clients must
check this.
	- scan_comment_proc and scan_dsc_proc are now deprecated, and will
disappear in the near future.
	- The values in psuserparams are now checking procedures rather
than parameter values.
	- Comments beginning with %! are treated as "DSC comments", like
comments beginning with %%.
(Library)
	- The macro for declaring the fill_rectangle procedure of a shading
is now upper-case.  The fill_rectangle procedure is now a member of a procs
structure; there is a new macro for calling it.
	- The parameter list and return value for gs_currentgray have
changed.  This is very unfortunate, but it was unavoidable.


<h2><a name="6.22 Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- The batch files for MS-DOS, MS Windows, and OS/2 referred to the
executable by the name 'gs'. They now use environment variables GS
(graphical) and GSC (console) for the executable names, defaulting to
gswin32 and gswin32c respectively. (doc/News.htm [1.45], doc/Use.htm [1.6]:
2000/05/20 20:53:04 lpd)
	- The -dCompatibilityLevel= switch was incorrectly identified in one
place as -dCompatibility=. (doc/Ps2pdf.htm [1.11]: 2000/05/22 21:29:45 lpd)
	- [gs_]currentgray didn't return the correct value if the current
color space was a DeviceN space using the alternate space.
(doc/News.htm [1.49]: 2000/07/03 15:28:26 lpd)
	- Fixes a couple of typos. (doc/Release.htm [1.12]: 2000/07/04

Adds a user-contributed driver for SFF (the file format for CAPI fax
devices). (contrib.mak [1.14]: 2000/06/06 06:38:31 lpd)

Notes that the vgalib driver only suppotrs 16-color modes. (devs.mak [1.27]:

anywhere else). (lib.mak [1.25]: 2000/07/05 00:48:21 lpd)

Changes the version numbering system back to sequential (not odd/even).

gs_main_init_with_args, causing clients to think Ghostscript was initialized
properly when it wasn't. (gsdll.c [1.2]: 2000/05/20 14:39:42 lpd)
	- The batch files for MS-DOS, MS Windows, and OS/2 referred to the

the documentation, and the code used the incorrect encoding.
(gdevatx.c [1.2]: 2000/05/06 00:31:25 lpd)
	- If a file made no marks at all, ps2[e]ps produced bad output.
(gdevps.c [1.8]: 2000/05/07 15:38:27 lpd)
	- Returning an image compression parameter dictionary didn't close
an enumeration, failing to free a bookkeeping structure. (gdevpsdp.c [1.5]:
2000/05/11 16:13:16 lpd)
	- The epswrite driver could produce output that used initclip, which
is not allowed in EPS files. (gdevps.c [1.9]: 2000/05/20 06:36:30 lpd)
	- The change to implement stripped TIFF files broke non-TIFF fax
output formats (faxg* drivers). Also factors plain-fax writing from TIFF
writing. (gdevfax.c [1.1], gdevfax.h [1.1], gdevtfax.c [1.3],
gdevtfax.h [1.3]: 2000/06/06 06:37:37 lpd)

	- Finishes fixing the handling of MaxBitmap in the X driver.
(gdevxini.c [1.5]: 2000/06/12 02:45:25 lpd)
	- In the ATX drivers, the word count for compressed scan lines was
written as 2 bytes rather than 1; the drivers wouldn't accept a page width
greater than 2400 pixels. (gdevatx.c [1.4]: 2000/06/12 04:39:48 lpd)

<h1><a name="Version6.21"></a>Version 6.21 (2000-04-28)</h1>

<p>
This fileset includes more PDF writer enhancements: conversion of embedded
Type 1 fonts to Type 1C (smaller), handling of more color spaces for images,
ImageType 4 images, compression of mask images, support for (tiled) Pattern
colors, more graphics state distiller parameters, recording of graphics
state functions in the output.  It also greatly improves the space usage and
loading time for CMaps.

<p>
All problems registered on SourceForge numbered 104890 or lower are closed,
except for the following: 101549, 101814, 101905, 101955, 102146, 102735,
103528, 104118, 104375.

<p>
The following projects are in a partially completed state in the PDF writer:

<ul>

<li>CID-keyed fonts (gdevpdf[eftw].c) -- barely started.

<li>ImageType 3 images (gdevpdf[ij].c) -- started.

<h2><a name="6.21_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Drivers)
	- The downsampling filters now require WidthIn and HeightIn,
replacing Columns.
	- The gp_ procedures for managing screen swapping between console
and graphics are removed.
	- Any driver that processes the pdfmark pseudo-parameter must now
also return null for the "value" of the pdfmark parameter when (and only
when) specifically requested.
(PDF writer)
	- The last argument of pdf_alloc_font has changed.
	- pdf_set_color is renamed pdf_set_pure_color.
	- When producing PDF 1.3 output, the base 14 fonts are now
candidates for embedding just like any other fonts.
(Interpreter)
	- The .fontproperties procedure in gs_fonts.ps now takes an
additional argument.
	- The interpreter must no longer reference stdin/out/err directly.
(Library)
	- The internal representation of CMaps is changed completely, and
has several new required members.
	- gs_cmap is renamed gs_cmap_t; gx_code_map is renamed
gx_code_map_t.
	- Clients creating CMaps must call gs_cmap_init to initialize them.
	- The library must no longer reference stdin/out/err directly.

4-element PageSizes in Input Attributes.) (lib/gs_setpd.ps [1.2]: 2000/04/19
06:01:19 lpd)
	- When choosing a substituted font, 'Serif' had priority over
'Sans', so unknown fonts with 'SansSerif' in their name would have a serif
font substituted. (lib/gs_fonts.ps [1.6]: 2000/04/19 13:48:48 lpd)
	- The fix to make setpagedevice ignore 4-element PageSizes in
InputAttributes was broken. (It's impossible that it could ever have worked,
despite the fact that we tested it.) (lib/gs_setpd.ps [1.3]: 2000/04/20
06:24:39 lpd)
	- When processing a PDF file, the font substitution heuristic based
on the FontName sometimes overrode the Flags information in the
FontDescriptor. (lib/gs_fonts.ps [1.7]: 2000/04/20 06:36:02 lpd)
	- Showing a string in a Type 1 font with a singular combined matrix
(e.g., after 0 scalefont setfont) caused an error instead of doing nothing.
(zchar1.c [1.3]: 2000/04/22 00:34:46 lpd)
	- Images with multiple file DataSources where two or more of the
files were the same caused a crash. (zimage.c [1.3]: 2000/04/24 00:07:41
lpd)
	- .reusablestreamdecode wasn't defined for use in LanguageLevel 2.
(The ReusableStreamDecode filter itself was properly defined.)
(lib/gs_frsd.ps [1.3]: 2000/04/24 00:45:38 lpd)
	- Loading an unknown font gave a spurious "non-string font name"
message; unknown fonts with names containing style strings like Bold or
Italic caused an error. (bug introduced since 6.20) (lib/gs_fonts.ps [1.8]:
2000/04/28 22:03:58 lpd)

Adds a workaround for misnamed glyphs in some Microsoft TrueType font 'post'

<h2><a name="6.20_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Procedures)
	- The default value of FPU_TYPE in all Windows and OS/2 makefiles
is now 387 rather than 0.
	- The process for reporting problems has changed significantly.
(PDF writer)
	- The Cos procedures no longer take the device as an argument,
except for object-creating procedures, which now take the device rather
than an allocator.
	- The is_object member of Cos values is replaced by value_type.
Clients must use COS_VALUE_IS_OBJECT() to test whether a value is an object
reference.
	- The Cos procedures that take C strings no longer copy the string.
	- The argument of cos_write_object is no longer const.
(Drivers)
	- The default BufferSpace for printer drivers is now 4 Mb.
	- Device halftone order implementations must now provide a new
bit_index procedure.

gs_image_t to gs_pixel_image_t.
	- The font-related psdf_ procedures are renamed psf_.
(Streams)
	- The interface to the [T]BCP filters is now in a separate file,
sbcp.h.
(PDF interpreter)
	- The internal beginpage procedure is renamed dictbeginpage, and
now takes a dictionary argument.
(Interpreter)
	- The argument list for the internal build_gs_TrueType_font
procedure has changed.
	- The zcharstring_glyph_outline procedure is renamed
zchar1_glyph_outline.
	- The Instances dictionary of resources is renamed .Instances.
(Library)

parameter list enumeration, is changed.
	- Implementors of parameter lists must now call gs_param_list_init
to initialize the common members.
	- st_indexed_map is now private.  Clients allocating instances of
this structure must now call alloc_indexed_map.
	- Setting a transfer map as the identity mapping now requires
calling gx_set_identity_transfer.
	- gs_cid_system_info is renamed gs_cid_system_info_t.
	- The get_outline procedure of a Type 42 or Type 11 (CIDFontType 0)
font now returns 1 if the string was newly allocated and can be freed by the
client.
	- The procs member of gs_type1_data is now an in-line structure
rather than a pointer to a const structure.


<h2><a name="6.20 Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- If log2_transfer_map_size > 8, identity transfer functions
returned garbage. The fix requires that if a client wants to set a transfer
function to the identity mapping, it must call gx_set_identity_transfer
rather than simply setting the procedure to gs_identity_transfer.
(doc/News.htm [1.13]: 2000/03/19 17:14:47 lpd)
	- In PDF files, the page CropBox was not being used to clip the
output. (doc/News.htm [1.18]: 2000/03/21 23:08:32 lpd)
	- Fixes several problems in resourceforall and resource loading: the
operands of resourceforall were restored even in the case of an error in the
client's procedure; the name Instances had special meaning for some Adobe
code; resourceforall caused an invalidaccess error if an operand was in
local VM but the current VM was global; loading a resource from a file could
cause a typecheck error if the file left values on the operand stack.
(doc/News.htm [1.25]: 2000/04/04 22:26:02 lpd)
	- The location of the lists of supported and unsupported drivers was
incorrect. (doc/Bug-info.htm [1.2]: 2000/04/07 03:01:52 lpd)

Undoes an accidental RCS ID substitution in what was supposed to be literal
text. (doc/Htmstyle.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/18 22:29:03 lpd)

Increments the version number to 6.20, in anticipation of the next release.

(doc/History6.htm [1.4], doc/News.htm [1.6]: 2000/03/19 00:27:22 lpd)

Splits out the [T]BCP filter interface into a separate file.

Documents the fact that ImageType 4 images now cause an error for
out-of-range MaskColor values. (doc/News.htm [1.8]: 2000/03/19 04:32:09 lpd)

Updates the change log with recent changes. (doc/Changes.htm [1.4]:
2000/03/19 05:39:58 lpd)

Adds a new document listing projects with which we are seeking help. Also
makes the description of Changes.htm and News.htm more accurate.
(doc/New-user.htm [1.2], doc/Projects.htm [1.1], doc/Readme.htm [1.3]:
2000/03/19 06:07:15 lpd)

Changes the default value of BufferSpace to 4 Mb. In desktop applications,
this is a reasonable value that can substantially improve performance
(especially for color printers); embedded applications will want to set
BufferSpace themselves in any case. (doc/News.htm [1.9]: 2000/03/19 06:51:13
lpd)

Changes the key type returned by parameter list enumeration to include a
persistence flag, makes C parameter lists support non-persistent keys, and
upgrades GC descriptors so that parameter lists can be used non-transiently;
updates implementors of parameter lists to call gs_param_list_init to
initialize the common members, which is now required. (doc/News.htm [1.10]:
2000/03/19 15:16:11 lpd)

Documents the fact that drivers that device halftone order implementations
must now provide the new bit_index procedure. (This should have been
documented when bit_index was introduced!) (doc/News.htm [1.11]: 2000/03/19
15:47:47 lpd)

Makes st_indexed_map private. Clients must now use the constructor procedure
alloc_indexed_map rather than allocating instances directly.
(doc/News.htm [1.12]: 2000/03/19 16:37:28 lpd)

Update the date and change log for the latest batches of checked-in changes.
(doc/Changes.htm [1.5]: 2000/03/19 17:29:57 lpd)

Adds a PDF linearizer ("optimizer"). This is a separate utility (not
integrated with the pdfwrite driver), written in PostScript.
(doc/Psfiles.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/20 04:31:22 lpd)

Adds parsing for the remaining Acrobat Distiller 4 parameters. Implements
the LockDistillerParams, xxxDownsampleThreshold, xxxImageDict, and
xxxACSImageDict distiller parameters. Implements DCTEncode as an
xxxImageFilter option (it used to cause a crash). Makes the
AutoFilterxxxImages distiller parameters select JPEG encoding (with ACSDict)
if the image has 8 bits per component and is not Indexed, and LZW/Flate
otherwise: this still isn't right, but it's closer. Implementation changes:
Changes the implementation of distiller parameter dictionaries from stream
states to parameter lists; changes the test for masks in
psdf_setup_image_filters, and changes the image argument from gs_image_t to
gs_pixel_image_t. (doc/News.htm [1.14]: 2000/03/20 05:40:04 lpd)

Moves font-writing support into a new module (gdevpsf*), changing the source
file names. Adds the ability to write CFF fonts, with either Type 1 or Type
2 CharStrings; unfortunately, Acrobat Reader appears not to accept CFF fonts
with Type 1 CharStrings. Adds the ability to convert Type 1 CharStrings to
Type 2, including optimizing sequences of Type 1 operators into a single
Type 2 operator. Implements writing CIDFontType 0 CFF fonts (CIDFonts) [NOT
TESTED]. Starts (just barely) to remove more unneeded information from
embedded TrueType fonts. (doc/News.htm [1.15]: 2000/03/20 07:02:12 lpd)

Updates the consolidated change log with today's changes.
(doc/Changes.htm [1.6]: 2000/03/20 07:18:38 lpd)

Starts to move support for CIDFontType 0 and 2 into C code, needed by the
PDF writer for handling CID-keyed fonts. Implements GlyphDirectory for
CIDFonts. Makes GDBytes and CIDMapOffset optional for CIDFontType 0 fonts
that have a GlyphDirectory (not documented in the PLRM, but clearly
correct). Implements Adobe 3011 features: integer and dictionary CIDMaps,
and the MetricsCount entry, in CIDFontType 2 fonts (but only in the C code,
which isn't hooked in yet, not in the PostScript code in gs_cidfn.ps.)
(doc/News.htm [1.16]: 2000/03/20 19:53:06 lpd)

Notes that the argument list for the internal build_gs_TrueType_font
procedure has changed, as part of the CIDFont migration to C code.
(doc/News.htm [1.17]: 2000/03/20 20:04:20 lpd)

Adds invocation scripts and documentation for the PDF "optimizer".
(man/pdfopt.1 [1.1]: 2000/03/21 17:01:33 lpd)

Updates information about reporting problems when using Ghostview or GSview.
(doc/Bug-form.htm [1.3], doc/New-user.htm [1.3]: 2000/03/22 22:13:49 lpd)

Checks in the latest consolidated change log. (doc/Changes.htm [1.7]:
2000/03/24 05:04:55 lpd)

Substantially enhances the Cos object machinery. Interface: Adds a few more
procedures, including a procedure to create a stream that writes directly
into a Cos stream object, procedures for putting more kinds of values into
arrays and dictionaries, and a param_list interface. Changes Cos objects to
store a reference to the PDF device, and removes the device argument from
all Cos procedures other than object creation. Replaces the Boolean
is_object member of Cos values by a value_type enum: clients must now use
COS_VALUE_IS_OBJECT() to test whether a value is an object reference. To
reduce allocator overhead, makes the Cos procedures that take C strings no
longer copy the string. Records whether each Cos object has been written
into the output, so that in the future (but not in this batch of changes)
resource definitions can be copied at the end of each page. Implementation:
Moves more of the implementation of Cos objects to the .c file.
(doc/News.htm [1.19]: 2000/03/24 06:12:52 lpd)

Adds parsing for the remaining Acrobat Distiller 4 parameters, although most
of them don't have any effect yet; brings documentation up to date.
(doc/Ps2pdf.htm [1.3]: 2000/03/28 07:36:58 lpd)

Implements LockDistillerParams; completes the StartPage/EndPage fix checked
in just before. (doc/Ps2pdf.htm [1.4]: 2000/03/28 07:52:06 lpd)

Changes the default value of FPU_TYPE in all Windows and OS/2 makefiles from
0 to 387, since all current desktop CPUs include floating point hardware.
(doc/News.htm [1.20]: 2000/03/28 17:03:48 lpd)

Changes the get_outline / glyph_data procedure for getting encoded font
outline data to return an indication of whether the outline data were just
allocated and can be freed by the client. (This is a possibly
non-backward-compatible change.) (doc/News.htm [1.21]: 2000/03/28 18:47:02
lpd)

Adds a note about bogus "ANSI aliasing" warnings from the DEC C compiler.
(doc/Make.htm [1.8]: 2000/03/29 19:29:08 lpd)

Changes the procs structure of gs_type1_data to an in-line structure rather
than a pointer to a const structure. (Needed for moving CIDFontType 0
support into C.) (doc/News.htm [1.22]: 2000/03/29 22:10:31 lpd)

Updates the change log with recent changes. (doc/Changes.htm [1.8]:

Adds dependencies for the new implementation of FunctionType 4 functions.
(int.mak [1.6]: 2000/03/19 07:03:53 lpd)

Splits off "vanilla" Functions into separate files, in anticipation of

Update the date and change log for the latest batches of checked-in changes.
(version.mak [1.7]: 2000/03/19 17:29:57 lpd)

Moves font-writing support into a new module (gdevpsf*), changing the source
file names. Adds the ability to write CFF fonts, with either Type 1 or Type
2 CharStrings; unfortunately, Acrobat Reader appears not to accept CFF fonts
with Type 1 CharStrings. Adds the ability to convert Type 1 CharStrings to
Type 2, including optimizing sequences of Type 1 operators into a single
Type 2 operator. Implements writing CIDFontType 0 CFF fonts (CIDFonts) [NOT
TESTED]. Starts (just barely) to remove more unneeded information from
embedded TrueType fonts. (devs.mak [1.4], lib.mak [1.5]: 2000/03/20 07:02:12

(devs.mak [1.6]: 2000/03/20 19:30:35 lpd)

Starts to move support for CIDFontType 0 and 2 into C code, needed by the
PDF writer for handling CID-keyed fonts. Implements GlyphDirectory for
CIDFonts. Makes GDBytes and CIDMapOffset optional for CIDFontType 0 fonts
that have a GlyphDirectory (not documented in the PLRM, but clearly
correct). Implements Adobe 3011 features: integer and dictionary CIDMaps,
and the MetricsCount entry, in CIDFontType 2 fonts (but only in the C code,
which isn't hooked in yet, not in the PostScript code in gs_cidfn.ps.)
(int.mak [1.8], lib.mak [1.7]: 2000/03/20 19:53:06 lpd)

Extends the C support for CIDFontType 0 fonts to include those with FontType
2 subfonts in the FDArray (an Adobe 3011 addition, specifically for CFF
fonts). (int.mak [1.9]: 2000/03/21 07:43:42 lpd)

Adds invocation scripts and documentation for the PDF "optimizer".
(unixinst.mak [1.6]: 2000/03/21 17:01:33 lpd)

Splits off the ReusableStreamDecode filter as a separate module, since
CIDFontType 0 fonts will use it even in LanguageLevels below 3.
(int.mak [1.10]: 2000/03/21 21:34:57 lpd)

Makes file streams remember the file name, needed for efficiently
implementing reusable streams. (int.mak [1.11]: 2000/03/23 02:13:40 lpd)

Checks in the latest consolidated change log. (version.mak [1.8]: 2000/03/24
05:04:55 lpd)

Changes the implementation of incrementally loaded CIDFontType 0 fonts to
use a ReusableStreamDecode filter, in anticipation of moving the BuildGlyph
procedure for these fonts from PostScript to C. (int.mak [1.12],
version.mak [1.9]: 2000/03/27 16:36:24 lpd)

Changes the default value of FPU_TYPE in all Windows and OS/2 makefiles from
0 to 387, since all current desktop CPUs include floating point hardware.

	- In the output of the pswrite driver (pdf2ps, ps2ps), the showpage

N-up printing not work properly. (gdevps.c [1.4]: 2000/03/28 00:52:46 lpd)

double printing. (gdevdjet.c [1.2]: 2000/04/03 14:36:12 lpd)

Adds parsing for the remaining Acrobat Distiller 4 parameters. Implements
the LockDistillerParams, xxxDownsampleThreshold, xxxImageDict, and
xxxACSImageDict distiller parameters. Implements DCTEncode as an
xxxImageFilter option (it used to cause a crash). Makes the
AutoFilterxxxImages distiller parameters select JPEG encoding (with ACSDict)
if the image has 8 bits per component and is not Indexed, and LZW/Flate

Substantially enhances the Cos object machinery. Interface: Adds a few more
procedures, including a procedure to create a stream that writes directly
into a Cos stream object, procedures for putting more kinds of values into
arrays and dictionaries, and a param_list interface. Changes Cos objects to
store a reference to the PDF device, and removes the device argument from
all Cos procedures other than object creation. Replaces the Boolean
is_object member of Cos values by a value_type enum: clients must now use
COS_VALUE_IS_OBJECT() to test whether a value is an object reference. To
reduce allocator overhead, makes the Cos procedures that take C strings no
longer copy the string. Records whether each Cos object has been written
into the output, so that in the future (but not in this batch of changes)
resource definitions can be copied at the end of each page. Implementation:

	- Re-registering a CIDFont with definefont, or defining a CIDFont
with definefont instead of /CIDFont defineresource, caused an invalidfont
error or a crash. (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.9], lib/gs_fonts.ps [1.4]: 2000/03/28
18:21:50 lpd)
	- The new C BuildGlyph code for CIDFontType 0 fonts didn't handle
GlyphDirectory or Type 2 CharStrings correctly. (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.12],
zfcid.c [1.8]: 2000/03/31 23:21:57 lpd)
	- The internaldict "operator" was allocated in local VM, preventing
it from being bound into procedures allocated in global VM.
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.6]: 2000/04/04 22:16:02 lpd)
	- If there was a CIDInit ProcSet defined in the filesystem, the code
for initializing the built-in CIDInit ProcSet became confused.
(lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.13]: 2000/04/04 22:17:33 lpd)
	- Fixes several problems in resourceforall and resource loading: the
operands of resourceforall were restored even in the case of an error in the
client's procedure; the name Instances had special meaning for some Adobe
code; resourceforall caused an invalidaccess error if an operand was in
local VM but the current VM was global; loading a resource from a file could
cause a typecheck error if the file left values on the operand stack.
(interp.c [1.3], lib/gs_ccfnt.ps [1.2], lib/gs_res.ps [1.3]: 2000/04/04
22:26:02 lpd)
	- resourceforall didn't enumerate external (loadable) instances, and
would enumerate an instance twice if it had both a local and a global
definition. (lib/gs_res.ps [1.4]: 2000/04/05 21:07:02 lpd)
	- The implementation of resourcestatus wasn't compatible with some
badly written code in an Adobe font downloader that assumes that the
implementation of resourcestatus in Generic and Font is the same.
(lib/gs_res.ps [1.5]: 2000/04/05 21:20:07 lpd)
	- The just-checked-in fixed for resourceforall didn't work properly
for the IdiomSet category. (They probably failed for other categories that
had no instances, but we didn't check this.) (lib/gs_res.ps [1.6]:
2000/04/05 21:51:43 lpd)
	- Some Adobe font downloading code assumed that loading a resource
file would never leave extra values on the stack; our implementation didn't
ensure this (by popping them if needed). (lib/gs_res.ps [1.8]: 2000/04/06
04:50:28 lpd)
	- If an alphabetic font defined and used a .notdef character,
pdfwrite always converted it to a bitmap. (lib/gs_lgo_e.ps [1.2]: 2000/04/07
02:48:23 lpd)

Provides a gs_atan2_degrees procedure to parallel sin and cos.
(zmath.c [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:10:39 lpd)

Speeds up string garbage collection by scanning unmodified string regions
faster. (igcstr.c [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:29:32 lpd)

Adds the ImagemaskTrapping parameter to the trapping state.
(lib/gs_trap.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:35:53 lpd)

Increments the version number to 6.20, in anticipation of the next release.
(We do this at the beginning of the development for a release, not the end.)
(lib/gs_init.ps [1.4]: 2000/03/19 00:27:22 lpd)

Adds a pseudo-encoding for the CFF StandardStrings that represent
characters. (lib/gs_cff.ps [1.2], lib/gs_css_e.ps [1.1]: 2000/03/19 00:38:50
lpd)

Refactors the code for getting Type 1/2/4 font parameters so it can be used
for FDArray entries of CIDFontType 0 fonts. (ifont1.h [1.2], zfont1.c [1.2]:
2000/03/19 02:07:45 lpd)

Speeds up Function evaluation slightly, by preallocating space for a
reasonable number of operands and results on the C stack rather than always
allocating it on the heap. (zfunc.c [1.3]: 2000/03/19 02:16:58 lpd)

Adds a public procedure for determining whether a PostScript object is a
Function, and if so, returning the pointer to the gs_function_t structure.
(ifunc.h [1.2], zfunc.c [1.4]: 2000/03/19 02:22:01 lpd)

Splits out the [T]BCP filter interface into a separate file. (zfbcp.c [1.2]:
2000/03/19 02:40:18 lpd)

Adds a skip_count parameter to the SubFileDecode filter, giving the number
of initial bytes or records to skip over. (Needed for printing FunctionType
4 functions, possibly useful for other things.) (sfilter1.c [1.3]:
2000/03/19 03:20:18 lpd)

Replaces the implementation of FunctionType 4 functions at the PostScript
language level with one that uses the new library-based facilities.
(zdevice2.c [1.2], zfunc4.c [1.2]: 2000/03/19 06:56:23 lpd)

Changes the key type returned by parameter list enumeration to include a
persistence flag, makes C parameter lists support non-persistent keys, and
upgrades GC descriptors so that parameter lists can be used non-transiently;
updates implementors of parameter lists to call gs_param_list_init to
initialize the common members, which is now required. (iparam.c [1.3]:
2000/03/19 15:16:11 lpd)

Makes Separation and DeviceN color spaces convert their tint transform
function to a FunctionType 4 Function if possible, for better accuracy and
to allow writing in PDF files. (lib/gs_lev2.ps [1.2], lib/gs_ll3.ps [1.2]:
2000/03/19 15:28:34 lpd)

Makes st_indexed_map private. Clients must now use the constructor procedure
alloc_indexed_map rather than allocating instances directly.
(zcsindex.c [1.2]: 2000/03/19 16:37:28 lpd)

Refactors the code for building fonts so it can be used for FDArray entries
of CIDFontType 0 fonts. (bfont.h [1.2], zbfont.c [1.2]: 2000/03/19 16:45:47
lpd)

Adds a .fileposition operator that will read the position even of
non-positionable streams, needed for the PDF linearizer. (zfileio.c [1.3]:
2000/03/20 04:30:49 lpd)

Starts to move support for CIDFontType 0 and 2 into C code, needed by the
PDF writer for handling CID-keyed fonts. Implements GlyphDirectory for
CIDFonts. Makes GDBytes and CIDMapOffset optional for CIDFontType 0 fonts
that have a GlyphDirectory (not documented in the PLRM, but clearly
correct). Implements Adobe 3011 features: integer and dictionary CIDMaps,
and the MetricsCount entry, in CIDFontType 2 fonts (but only in the C code,
which isn't hooked in yet, not in the PostScript code in gs_cidfn.ps.)
(icid.h [1.1], ifont.h [1.2], ifont42.h [1.1], zcid.c [1.2], zfcid.c [1.1],
zfcmap.c [1.3], zfont42.c [1.2]: 2000/03/20 19:53:06 lpd)

Hooks the new CIDMap code into the BuildGlyph procedure for CIDFontType 2
fonts. (Contrary to a previous log comment, MetricsCount is already hooked
in.) Support for CIDFontType 2 fonts is now implemented entirely in C, as
for Type 42 fonts. (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.6], zfcid.c [1.2]: 2000/03/21
00:32:15 lpd)

Extends the C support for CIDFontType 0 fonts to include those with FontType
2 subfonts in the FDArray (an Adobe 3011 addition, specifically for CFF
fonts). (ifont2.h [1.1], zfcid.c [1.4], zfont2.c [1.2]: 2000/03/21 07:43:42
lpd)

Changes Subr loading for CIDFontType 0 fonts from lazy to immediate, so that
C code can be guaranteed access to the Subrs. (In every CIDFontType 0 font
that we have seen, SubrCount is 5, so this has no significant time or space
cost.) Also adds support for FDBytes > 1 in GlyphDirectory definitions.
(lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.7]: 2000/03/21 20:06:44 lpd)

Splits off the ReusableStreamDecode filter as a separate module, since
CIDFontType 0 fonts will use it even in LanguageLevels below 3.
(lib/gs_frsd.ps [1.1], lib/gs_ll3.ps [1.3], zfrsd.c [1.1]: 2000/03/21
21:34:57 lpd)

Makes file streams remember the file name, needed for efficiently
implementing reusable streams. (zfile.c [1.3], zfileio.c [1.4]: 2000/03/23
02:13:40 lpd)

Changes the new .filename operator to return true/false rather than causing
an error; redefines findlibfile in terms of a simpler .libfile operator +
.filename. (lib/gs_init.ps [1.5], zfile.c [1.4], zfileio.c [1.5]: 2000/03/23
18:47:17 lpd)

Finishes implementing the file case of ReusableStreamDecode. This required
adding the ability to restrict file-reading streams to a subfile.
(lib/gs_frsd.ps [1.2], sfilter1.c [1.4], zfileio.c [1.6], zfrsd.c [1.2]:
2000/03/24 03:59:42 lpd)

Changes the implementation of incrementally loaded CIDFontType 0 fonts to
use a ReusableStreamDecode filter, in anticipation of moving the BuildGlyph
procedure for these fonts from PostScript to C. (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.8],
zbfont.c [1.3], zfcid.c [1.5]: 2000/03/27 16:36:24 lpd)

Changes the get_outline / glyph_data procedure for getting encoded font
outline data to return an indication of whether the outline data were just
allocated and can be freed by the client. (This is a possibly
non-backward-compatible change.) (zfcid.c [1.6]: 2000/03/28 18:47:02 lpd)

Changes the procs structure of gs_type1_data to an in-line structure rather
than a pointer to a const structure. (Needed for moving CIDFontType 0
support into C.) (zfont1.c [1.3]: 2000/03/29 22:10:31 lpd)

Finishes moving support for CIDFontType 0 fonts from PostScript to C.
(ifont.h [1.3], ifont42.h [1.2], lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.10], zfcid.c [1.7],
zfont42.c [1.4]: 2000/03/31 04:55:18 lpd)

Allows dictionaries as the value of CIDMap resources. (Also removes an
unrelated obsolete comment.) (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.11]: 2000/03/31 05:11:30
lpd)

Finishes implementing the ability to write CIDFontType 0 CFFs. This involved
a surprising number of changes in other font-related files. (ichar1.h [1.2],
ifcid.h [1.1], zchar1.c [1.2], zfcid.c [1.9], zfcid0.c [1.1],
zfcid1.c [1.1], zfont1.c [1.4]: 2000/04/02 07:38:46 lpd)

Makes the .writefont9 operator (used only for testing) available in both
DEBUG and PROFILE configurations. (zfcid0.c [1.2]: 2000/04/03 02:37:55 lpd)

Extends .forceput to handle arrays as well as dictionaries, required to fix
a bug with internaldict. (zdict.c [1.2], zgeneric.c [1.2]: 2000/04/04
22:13:23 lpd)

Works around an Adobe code assumption that the default FindResource
procedure does *not* call the ResourceStatus procedure if the requested
instance is already defined in VM. (lib/gs_res.ps [1.7]: 2000/04/05 23:31:54
lpd)

Implements the framework for superexec (but none of the actual access check
bypasses). (icontext.c [1.2], icstate.h [1.2], zcontrol.c [1.2]: 2000/04/06
04:40:06 lpd)

Extends the undocumented CCRun procedure to take an additional argument, a
Private dictionary, required by some Adobe font downloading code.
(lib/gs_type1.ps [1.3]: 2000/04/06 05:25:10 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.20 Streams"></a>Streams</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- s_add_filter didn't ensure enough buffering. This entailed moving
the NullEncode/Decode filters to stream.[hc]. (sfilter.h [1.3],
stream.c [1.3], stream.h [1.3]: 2000/03/19 03:15:02 lpd)
	- When FPU_TYPE <= 0, the image interpolation code lost too much
accuracy, producing color streaks in the output. (Fix by DanCoby.)
(siscale.c [1.2]: 2000/03/29 20:34:45 lpd)
	- Fixes a couple of typos in the recently checked-in image
interpolation fix. (siscale.c [1.3]: 2000/03/30 06:55:26 lpd)

Splits out the [T]BCP filter interface into a separate file. (sbcp.c [1.2],
sbcp.h [1.1], sfilter.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 02:40:18 lpd)

Adds a skip_count parameter to the SubFileDecode filter, giving the number
of initial bytes or records to skip over. (Needed for printing FunctionType
4 functions, possibly useful for other things.) (sfilter.h [1.4]: 2000/03/19
03:20:18 lpd)

Changes the key type returned by parameter list enumeration to include a
persistence flag, makes C parameter lists support non-persistent keys, and
upgrades GC descriptors so that parameter lists can be used non-transiently;
updates implementors of parameter lists to call gs_param_list_init to
initialize the common members, which is now required. (spsdf.c [1.2]:
2000/03/19 15:16:11 lpd)

Makes file streams remember the file name, needed for efficiently
implementing reusable streams. (stream.c [1.4], stream.h [1.4]: 2000/03/23
02:13:40 lpd)

Finishes implementing the file case of ReusableStreamDecode. This required
adding the ability to restrict file-reading streams to a subfile.
(sfxfd.c [1.2], sfxstdio.c [1.2], stream.c [1.5], stream.h [1.5]: 2000/03/24
03:59:42 lpd)

Changes a few initializations to suppress warnings from one picky compiler
that doesn't like ptr = buf - 1 where buf is an array. (spsdf.c [1.3]:
2000/03/28 02:01:34 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.20 Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Two comments in the file were incorrect. (gsiparm3.h [1.2]:
2000/03/19 02:46:11 lpd)
	- param_coerce_typed, which works with any parameter list
implementation, was incorrectly described as associated with the default
implementation. (gsparam.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 03:37:08 lpd)
	- TrueType fonts didn't use vhea/vmtx if WMode = 1. Also makes
gs_font_type42 subclassable, for implementing CIDFontType 2 fonts, and makes
its procedure for getting a glyph's side bearing and width virtual, required
to support MetricsCount in CIDFontType 2 fonts. (gstype42.c [1.3],
gxfont42.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 03:58:51 lpd)
	- ImageType 4 images didn't give an error for out-of-range MaskColor
values. The file also had an unnecessary #include. (gximage4.c [1.2]:
2000/03/19 04:10:09 lpd)
	- If log2_transfer_map_size > 8, identity transfer functions
returned garbage. The fix requires that if a client wants to set a transfer
function to the identity mapping, it must call gx_set_identity_transfer
rather than simply setting the procedure to gs_identity_transfer.
(gxclrast.c [1.3], gxcmap.c [1.2], gxfmap.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 17:14:47 lpd)
	- Fixes a warning about aliasing produced by one extremely picky
compiler. (gsnogc.c [1.2]: 2000/03/22 21:39:32 lpd)
	- Filling or clipping with ridiculously large (out-of-bounds)
coordinates could cause an internal overflow that produced incorrect
results. (This is probably not the last such bug.) (gxfill.c [1.2]:
2000/03/30 07:03:59 lpd)

Provides a gs_atan2_degrees procedure to parallel sin and cos.
(gsmisc.c [1.2], gxfarith.h [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:10:39 lpd)

Improves the 8x8 bitmap "flipping" procedure to take advantage of 32-bit
ints. (gsutil.c [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:16:16 lpd)

Adds a public procedure for restricting a color to its legal range.
(gscspace.c [1.2], gscspace.h [1.2], gxcspace.h [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:19:17

Adds the new ImagemaskTrapping parameter to the trapping state.
(gstrap.c [1.2], gstrap.h [1.2]: 2000/03/18 23:26:17 lpd)

Increments the version number to 6.20, in anticipation of the next release.
(We do this at the beginning of the development for a release, not the end.)
(gscdef.c [1.2]: 2000/03/19 00:27:22 lpd)

Adds a pseudo-encoding for the CFF StandardStrings that represent
characters. (gsccode.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 00:38:50 lpd)

Adds a bit_index procedure to the implementation of device halftones,
required for writing halftones in PDF files. (The only implementors are
internal ones.) (gxdht.h [1.2], gxhtbit.c [1.2]: 2000/03/19 05:10:55 lpd)

Adds a public procedure for getting a palette entry of an Indexed color
space, used when writing Indexed color spaces in PDF files.
(gscindex.h [1.1], gscolor2.c [1.2], gscolor2.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 05:20:28
lpd)

Reimplements "PostScript calculator" (FunctionType 4) functions entirely in
C, to allow them to be written out in PDF files. (gsfunc4.c [1.1],
gsfunc4.h [1.1], gsstruct.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 05:25:53 lpd)

Moves gx_device_color_equal to the public API, for detecting redundant color
setting when writing PDF files. (gsdcolor.h [1.2], gxdcolor.c [1.2],
gxdcolor.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 06:46:08 lpd)

Changes the default value of BufferSpace to 4 Mb. In desktop applications,
this is a reasonable value that can substantially improve performance
(especially for color printers); embedded applications will want to set
BufferSpace themselves in any case. (gdevprn.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 06:51:13
lpd)

Adds virtual procedures for Functions to write their parameters to a
parameter list, and to access their data source and subfunctions. This is
needed for writing Functions in PDF files. This change is also a
prerequisite for the C implemention of FunctionType 4 functions, even though
it appears later in the change log. (gsdsrc.h [1.2], gsfunc.c [1.2],
gsfunc.h [1.2], gsfunc0.c [1.2], gsfunc3.c [1.2], gsparam.c [1.2],
gsparam.h [1.3], gxfunc.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 07:24:53 lpd)

Splits off "vanilla" Functions into separate files, in anticipation of
removing them (they were only used to implement PostScript Calculator
Functions). (gsfunc.c [1.3], gsfunc.h [1.3], gsfuncv.c [1.1],
gsfuncv.h [1.1]: 2000/03/19 07:33:08 lpd)

Adds a procedure for allocating a C parameter list. (gscparam.c [1.2],
gsparam.h [1.4]: 2000/03/19 15:00:05 lpd)

Undoes a premature change that depends on an update not yet checked in.
(gscparam.c [1.3]: 2000/03/19 15:07:59 lpd)

Changes the key type returned by parameter list enumeration to include a
persistence flag, makes C parameter lists support non-persistent keys, and
upgrades GC descriptors so that parameter lists can be used non-transiently;
updates implementors of parameter lists to call gs_param_list_init to
initialize the common members, which is now required. (gscparam.c [1.4],
gsparam.c [1.3], gsparam.h [1.5]: 2000/03/19 15:16:11 lpd)

Adds a procedure for copying one parameter list to another.
(gsparamx.c [1.2], gsparamx.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 15:35:31 lpd)

Records the CTM used for sampling HalftoneType 1 spot functions. This is
needed for recognizing the standard spot functions when producing PDF
output. Also factors the code for initializing spot functions for the
benefit of the PDF writer. (gshtscr.c [1.2], gxdht.h [1.3], gzht.h [1.2]:
2000/03/19 15:43:36 lpd)

Adds a proc_data member to the map for Separation and Indexed color spaces.
(gscolor2.c [1.3], gxcolor2.h [1.2]: 2000/03/19 16:23:46 lpd)

Makes st_indexed_map private. Clients must now use the constructor procedure
alloc_indexed_map rather than allocating instances directly.

2000/03/19 16:37:28 lpd)

Adds procedures for building and accessing DeviceN color spaces.
(gscdevn.c [1.2], gscdevn.h [1.1]: 2000/03/19 17:02:37 lpd)

Exports the 'blend' operators of the Type 1 interpreter, for use by the Type
1 / Type 2 font writer. (gstype1.c [1.3], gxtype1.c [1.2], gxtype1.h [1.3]:
2000/03/19 18:46:44 lpd)

Starts to move support for CIDFontType 0 and 2 fonts into C code. (These
header files are the ones needed to compile the new gdevpsf* files; they
don't interact with any existing code.) (gxcid.h [1.1], gxfcid.h [1.1]:
2000/03/20 06:40:22 lpd)

Moves font-writing support into a new module (gdevpsf*), changing the source
file names. Adds the ability to write CFF fonts, with either Type 1 or Type
2 CharStrings; unfortunately, Acrobat Reader appears not to accept CFF fonts
with Type 1 CharStrings. Adds the ability to convert Type 1 CharStrings to
Type 2, including optimizing sequences of Type 1 operators into a single
Type 2 operator. Implements writing CIDFontType 0 CFF fonts (CIDFonts) [NOT
TESTED]. Starts (just barely) to remove more unneeded information from
embedded TrueType fonts. (gxttf.h [1.1]: 2000/03/20 07:02:12 lpd)

Starts to move support for CIDFontType 0 and 2 into C code, needed by the
PDF writer for handling CID-keyed fonts. Implements GlyphDirectory for
CIDFonts. Makes GDBytes and CIDMapOffset optional for CIDFontType 0 fonts
that have a GlyphDirectory (not documented in the PLRM, but clearly
correct). Implements Adobe 3011 features: integer and dictionary CIDMaps,
and the MetricsCount entry, in CIDFontType 2 fonts (but only in the C code,
which isn't hooked in yet, not in the PostScript code in gs_cidfn.ps.)
(gsfcid.c [1.1], gsfcmap.c [1.3], gxfcmap.h [1.2], gxfont1.h [1.2]:

that doesn't like ptr = buf - 1 where buf is an array. (gxclpath.c [1.2]:

Changes the get_outline / glyph_data procedure for getting encoded font
outline data to return an indication of whether the outline data were just
allocated and can be freed by the client. (This is a possibly
non-backward-compatible change.) (gxfcid.h [1.2], gxfont42.h [1.3]:
2000/03/28 18:47:02 lpd)

Changes the procs structure of gs_type1_data to an in-line structure rather
than a pointer to a const structure. (Needed for moving CIDFontType 0
support into C.) (gstype1.c [1.4], gstype2.c [1.3], gxfont1.h [1.3],
gxtype1.c [1.3]: 2000/03/29 22:10:31 lpd)

Finishes moving support for CIDFontType 0 fonts from PostScript to C.
(gxfcid.h [1.3]: 2000/03/31 04:55:18 lpd)

Finishes implementing the ability to write CIDFontType 0 CFFs. This involved
a surprising number of changes in other font-related files. (gsfcid.c [1.2],
gxfcid.h [1.4]: 2000/04/02 07:38:46 lpd)

<h2><a name="6.01_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h2>

(Platforms)
	- OpenVMS using VAX C is no longer supported.  (OpenVMS with DEC C
and gcc are still supported.)
(Drivers)
	- The third argument of psdf_set_color is changed from const char *
to const psdf_set_color_commands_t *.
(Interpreter)
	- The non-standard feature of writing dictionaries in binary object
output is now disabled by default, but can now be enabled dynamically.
(Library)
	- The definition of TRANSPARENCY_PER_H_P is moved from gdevmrop.h to
gsropt.h.
	- The handling of the source opaque, texture transparent case of
RasterOp when TRANSPARENCY_PER_H_P is defined is changed slightly.


<h2><a name="6.01 Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Fixes a typo. (man/ps2pdf.1 [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:11:06 lpd)

In ansi2knr, adds user-contributed support for concatenated string literals
and character constants, and fixes for a couple of minor bugs.
(man/ansi2knr.1 [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:16:17 lpd)

Removes an inappropriate copying notice. (doc/Hershey.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/10
07:03:57 lpd)

Clarifies when xdpyinfo and xwininfo are needed. Adds privacy options for
problem reports. (doc/Bug-form.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:06:08 lpd)

Adds a new eps2eps utility analogous to ps2ps. (man/eps2eps.1 [1.1],
man/ps2ps.1 [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:51:55 lpd)

Updates the documentation on making RPMs, which is no longer supported.
(doc/Install.htm [1.2], doc/Make.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:58:00 lpd)

Adds a recommendation to use gcc on SGI platforms. (doc/Make.htm [1.3]:
2000/03/10 07:59:53 lpd)

(doc/Make.htm [1.4]: 2000/03/10 08:01:35 lpd)

Removes support for VAX C, which DEC stopped supporting 9 (!) years ago.
(doc/Make.htm [1.5], doc/Use.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/10 08:02:59 lpd)

Updates the documentation for building Aladdin releases to reflect revised
procedures for the Windows executable, and a few other minor changes.

Adds the ability to compile on OS/2 with XFree86. (doc/Install.htm [1.3],
doc/Make.htm [1.6]: 2000/03/10 19:50:49 lpd)

Moves all history for versions 5.n into History5.htm; creates History6.htm
for versions 6.n; redefines News.htm as containing only news for the current
release; adds (a link to) Changes.htm for the mechanically generated change
log. (doc/History5.htm [1.2], doc/History6.htm [1.1], doc/News.htm [1.2],
doc/README [1.2], doc/Readme.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/14 06:14:43 lpd)

may omit this file (doc/Changes.htm) from their change log.
(doc/Changes.htm [1.1], doc/News.htm [1.3]: 2000/03/14 06:48:44 lpd)

Revises the release procedures to reflect use of SourceForge, and to
separate out the procedures for building Windows executables.

Adds the ability to set the ProcessColorModel of the pdfwrite device to
/DeviceGray, /DeviceRGB, or /DeviceCMYK. This affects the color space used
for fill, stroke, text, and imagemask, and for images that (for whatever
reason) can't be written in their specified color space. Note that this is a
short-term fix: pdfwrite should output colors in the color space in which
they were specified. However, a proper fix will require more significant
architectural changes. (doc/News.htm [1.4]: 2000/03/16 01:21:23 lpd)

Adds a reference to a third-party Fontmap for the Computer Modern fonts.
(doc/Fonts.htm [1.2]: 2000/03/16 04:05:07 lpd)

Adds documentation and a makefile entry for Matthew Gelhaus' cdj880 driver.

enough. (doc/Devices.htm [1.3]: 2000/03/16 08:09:42 lpd)

Updates the version number reference in the troff header.
(man/ps2pdf.1 [1.3], man/ps2ps.1 [1.3]: 2000/03/17 00:47:08 lpd)

Removes the attempted documentation on building Windows executable
distributions: it was never correct, and Aladdin will no longer be creating
such distributions. Also reorganizes the document slightly and brings the
rest of it fully into line with reality. (doc/Release.htm [1.6]: 2000/03/17
04:40:47 lpd)

Adds information on building with the Intel C/C++ optimizing compiler
(requires the Microsoft Visual C++ environment), and fixes a typo in the
link to ftp.cdrom.com. (doc/Make.htm [1.7]: 2000/03/17 17:42:59 lpd)

Checks in the first wrap-up for the 6.01 release. (doc/Changes.htm [1.2],
doc/History6.htm [1.2], doc/News.htm [1.5]: 2000/03/18 04:13:40 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- The terminating $ on the $Id: line in gsmalloc.c was missing, and
dwuninst.rc lacked a $Id: line. (dwuninst.rc [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:44:33 lpd)
	- The %ram% IODevice was defined, but should not be (it represents a
RAM-based file system, which Ghostscript does not provide). Fix: The type of
the %null% IODevice was /FileSystem rather than /Special. (int.mak [1.2]:
2000/03/10 07:02:07 lpd)
	- The dependency list for coslwxl omitted a $(DD).
(contrib.mak [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:30:54 lpd)
	- The makefile still referred to a long-gone driver for the DEC
LA70. (contrib.mak [1.3]: 2000/03/10 07:32:43 lpd)
	- The Unix install process tried to make links without deleting them
first. (unixinst.mak [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:49:21 lpd)
	- The Watcom compiler switches didn't force enums to occupy a full
int, leading to execution errors because the code casts (enum *) pointers to
(int *). (wccommon.mak [1.2]: 2000/03/10 08:15:31 lpd)
	- The Windows zip archive didn't include font metrics files. (This
change only fixes the build procedure: it doesn't actually update the
currently released zip archive.) (winint.mak [1.2]: 2000/03/10 08:17:06 lpd)
	- the "all architectures" build and test script hadn't been updated
to use different STDLIBS values depending on where the platform provides the
pthreads library. (all-arch.mak [1.2]: 2000/03/10 15:40:43 lpd)
	- The documentation for building with pthreads on FreeBSD hadn't
been updated. (unix-gcc.mak [1.2], unixansi.mak [1.2], unixtrad.mak [1.2]:
2000/03/10 15:44:01 lpd)
	- gsmalloc.c didn't include the prototype for gs_exit(), which it
calls. (lib.mak [1.2]: 2000/03/10 15:53:08 lpd)

Because of rampant confusion, disagreement, and lack of standardization,
removes the RPM-related spec and patch files. (gs-fonts.rps [1.2],
gs.rps [1.2], rpm-conf.dif [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:22:04 lpd)

Increases the stack size for the PC platforms, since a user had reported
that the OS/2 stack size was too small. (dw32c.def [1.2],
dwmain32.def [1.2], gsos2.def [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:33:21 lpd)

Updates the Brother HL7xx drivers with a new user-contributed version, plus
a couple of minor fixes. (contrib.mak [1.4]: 2000/03/10 07:33:44 lpd)

Adds a new eps2eps utility analogous to ps2ps. (unixinst.mak [1.3]:
2000/03/10 07:51:55 lpd)

Removes support for VAX C, which DEC stopped supporting 9 (!) years ago.
(openvms.mak [1.2], openvms.mmk [1.2]: 2000/03/10 08:02:59 lpd)

Updates all makefiles to the current libpng version, 1.0.5.
(bcwin32.mak [1.2], dvx-gcc.mak [1.2], msvc32.mak [1.2], msvclib.mak [1.2],
os2.mak [1.2], ugcclib.mak [1.2], unix-gcc.mak [1.3], unixansi.mak [1.3],
unixtrad.mak [1.3], watc.mak [1.2], watclib.mak [1.2], watcw32.mak [1.2]:
2000/03/10 15:48:58 lpd)

Updates the version # to 6.01, and the version date. (version.mak [1.2]:
2000/03/10 17:18:29 lpd)

Adds the ability to compile on OS/2 with XFree86. (os2.mak [1.3]: 2000/03/10
19:50:49 lpd)

Moves all history for versions 5.n into History5.htm; creates History6.htm
for versions 6.n; redefines News.htm as containing only news for the current
release; adds (a link to) Changes.htm for the mechanically generated change
log. (unixinst.mak [1.4], version.mak [1.3]: 2000/03/14 06:14:44 lpd)

Adds entries for ibm-rs6000-aix-4.3, sgi-mips-irix6.5-64bit, and
sun-sparc-solaris-64bit. (all-arch.mak [1.3]: 2000/03/15 18:38:29 lpd)

Adds the ability to set the ProcessColorModel of the pdfwrite device to
/DeviceGray, /DeviceRGB, or /DeviceCMYK. This affects the color space used
for fill, stroke, text, and imagemask, and for images that (for whatever
reason) can't be written in their specified color space. Note that this is a
short-term fix: pdfwrite should output colors in the color space in which
they were specified. However, a proper fix will require more significant
architectural changes. (version.mak [1.4]: 2000/03/16 01:21:24 lpd)

Adds documentation and a makefile entry for Matthew Gelhaus' cdj880 driver.
The code will eventually be included in gdevcd8.c, but it is not yet mature
enough. (contrib.mak [1.5]: 2000/03/16 08:09:42 lpd)

Adds a missing dependency of gdevpdft.o on gxfont42.h. (devs.mak [1.2]:
2000/03/17 02:59:26 lpd)

Adds a disclaimer of responsibility for the makefile section for creating
distribution archives, which Aladdin is no longer maintaining.
(winint.mak [1.3]: 2000/03/17 03:01:58 lpd)

Checks in the first wrap-up for the 6.01 release. (unix-gcc.mak [1.4],
version.mak [1.5]: 2000/03/18 04:13:40 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- The loader for the stochastic halftone incorrectly assumed that
the resource file left the resource on the stack, causing a stackunderflow
error. (lib/stocht.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:34:44 lpd)
	- The ps2pdf*.bat scripts didn't set PS2PDFSW to the empty string if
there were no arguments, causing the same file to be processed again.
(lib/ps2pdf12.bat [1.2], lib/ps2pdf13.bat [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:40:00 lpd)
	- Fixes a typo in the fix for putting stdout in binary mode.
(gp_ntfs.c [1.3]: 2000/03/18 01:15:16 lpd)
	- For printer devices, a non-null definition for OutputFile was
required even on platforms that had a default printer (as implemented by
gp_open_printer for that platform). (gp_os9.c [1.2], gp_unix.c [1.2],
gp_vms.c [1.2]: 2000/03/18 01:45:16 lpd)

In ansi2knr, adds user-contributed support for concatenated string literals
and character constants, and fixes for a couple of minor bugs.
(ansi2knr.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:16:17 lpd)

Updates the pf2afm.ps utility with a revised version from its authors.
(lib/pf2afm.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:35:37 lpd)

Adds a new eps2eps utility analogous to ps2ps. (lib/eps2eps [1.1],
lib/eps2eps.bat [1.1]: 2000/03/10 07:51:55 lpd)

Removes a temporary file that was included in the fileset by mistake.
(lib/history [1.2]: 2000/03/10 08:18:36 lpd)

Changes the ps2pdf MS Windows / MS-DOS scripts to use temporary files to
avoid the absurdly low limits on the length of a command line and the total
size of environment variable definitions. (lib/ps2pdf.bat [1.2],
lib/ps2pdf12.bat [1.3], lib/ps2pdf13.bat [1.3], lib/ps2pdfwr.bat [1.2],
lib/ps2pdfxx.bat [1.1]: 2000/03/14 20:20:20 lpd)

On Windows, puts stdout into binary mode as well as stdin, to allow piping
printer output through stdout (not a good idea, but it should be supported
as well as on other platforms). (gp_ntfs.c [1.2]: 2000/03/17 06:22:59 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 Drivers"></a>Drivers</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- When converting PostScript to PDF, selecting /Bicubic as an image
DownsampleType caused an error instead of defaulting to /Average.
(gdevpsdf.h [1.2], gdevpsdi.c [1.2], gdevpsdp.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:16:09
lpd)
	- The mswinpr2 driver didn't handle setting BitsPerPixel to the same
value when the device was already open, possibly causing an error on restore
or grestore. (gdevwpr2.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:26:07 lpd)
	- When operating in buffered mode (MaxBitmap > 0), the X driver
sometimes failed to copy all of the updated area to the screen.
(gdevx.c [1.2], gdevx.h [1.2], gdevxini.c [1.2], gdevxxf.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10
06:56:27 lpd)
	- The [e]pswrite driver produced invalid output if the input file
didn't end with a showpage. Also cleans up some formatting and removes a
redundant test. (gdevps.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:44:27 lpd)
	- Fixes a problem producing too much black in the output; also adds
support for 5 new printers (H-P Color DeskJet 690, H-P DesignJet 750, and
Epson Stylus Color 200). Note that this is user-contributed code.

	- The X driver's algorithm for deciding when to update the screen
was changed several times between 5.50 and 6.0, and one of the more recent
changes caused it to copy many more pixels to the screen than necessary if
the file was making marks on the page in widely separated places.
(gdevx.c [1.3]: 2000/03/17 07:35:43 lpd)
	- In the X driver, the full-page buffer controlled by -dMaxBitmap=
wasn't allocated with a stable allocator, possibly leading to memory access
errors if save/restore were used. (gdevxini.c [1.3]: 2000/03/18 04:11:59

Updates the Brother HL7xx drivers with a new user-contributed version, plus
a couple of minor fixes. (gdevhl7x.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:33:44 lpd)

Enhances the [e]pswrite driver to handle Indexed color spaces over Device
color spaces, only with the standard Decode. (gdevps.c [1.3]: 2000/03/10
07:45:50 lpd)

Adds the ability to set the ProcessColorModel of the pdfwrite device to
/DeviceGray, /DeviceRGB, or /DeviceCMYK. This affects the color space used
for fill, stroke, text, and imagemask, and for images that (for whatever
reason) can't be written in their specified color space. Note that this is a
short-term fix: pdfwrite should output colors in the color space in which
they were specified. However, a proper fix will require more significant
architectural changes. (gdevpsdf.c [1.2], gdevpsdf.h [1.3]: 2000/03/16

Adds two more user-contributed 'uniprint' printer parameter sets: Epson
Stylus Color 640, and a generic Epson Stylus Color in high resolution mode
(720x720 dpi). (lib/stc640p.upp [1.1], lib/stcany_h.upp [1.1]: 2000/03/16

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 PDF writer"></a>PDF writer</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- In-line images emitted an extra 'q' (gsave), causing the CTM to
become incorrect, entries to pile up on the dictionary stack, and an
invalidrestore error to occur at the end of the page. (gdevpdfi.c [1.2]:
2000/03/10 03:47:37 lpd)
	- The change in 5.99 to work around Acrobat Reader's 32K limit on
user space coordinates caused all 0-width rectangles to disappear, which had
major effects on some files. (gdevpdfd.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:48:10 lpd)
	- Incrementally downloaded TrueType fonts produced truncated Widths
tables in the output. We have patched this with a ******HACK****** that
causes such fonts to be converted to bitmaps: the correct fix (to delay
determining the range of valid characters until the font is written) is too
large a change to make in a bug fix release. (gdevpdft.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10

Fixes problems:
	- When interpreting a PDF file, the Install page device procedure
got more and more deeply nested after every page, eventually causing an
execstackoverflow. (lib/pdf_main.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:56:11 lpd)
	- When interpreting a PDF file, text drawing operators didn't reset
the text position, so strings could get displayed on top of each other. (bug
introduced by a fix in 5.98) (lib/pdf_ops.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:57:03 lpd)
	- When interpreting a PDF file, substituted small-cap fonts were

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 Interpreter"></a>Interpreter</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- There were extraneous 'def' commands that caused definitions to be
made in the wrong dictionary. (lib/gs_ttf.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:31:39 lpd)
	- If an error occurred while loading a font, it wouldn't produce an
error message. (This is a 'fix' of a 'fix' of a 'fix': it might well break
something else.) (lib/gs_type1.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:37:14 lpd)
	- When reading the strings of a binary object sequence, having to
get more data from a procedure-based stream sometimes caused a syntaxerror.
Fix: If the reserved (0) field in binary objects or binary object sequences
was not 0, no syntaxerror occurred. (iscanbin.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:38:50
lpd)
	- The code for handling execstackoverflow errors didn't cut back the
stack correctly, possibly causing invalid memory accesses if an incorrect
attempt was made to run a cleanup procedure. (interp.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10
04:04:38 lpd)
	- Writing of dictionaries in binary object output, a non-standard
extension, was enabled by default, and also had to be enabled at startup
time if it was ever going to be used. Fix: Binary error messages caused an
error if the command wasn't of a type that printobject could handle. We now
do what the Adobe implementations appear to do in this case, namely, convert
the object with cvs. (lib/gs_btokn.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:27:31 lpd)

streams. (zfileio.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:35:53 lpd)
	- Images with input from a file or filter demanded 1 byte of data
too many, sometimes causing the last line of the image to be dropped. (bug
probably introduced in 6.0) (zimage.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:37:02 lpd)
	- The check for a show within a cshow procedure for a CID font was
wrong. Fix: Character widths in CIDFontType 0 fonts were ignored (!). Adds a
.glyphwidth operator to support correct handling of character widths for CID
fonts. Adds a glyphwidth procedure to the library, like glyphshow and
glyphpath, in order to support correct handling of widths for CID fonts.
(ichar.h [1.2], lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.2], zchar.c [1.2], zcharx.c [1.2]:
2000/03/10 04:41:47 lpd)
	- resourcestatus for fonts was broken. (lib/gs_res.ps [1.2]:
2000/03/10 04:54:15 lpd)
	- Fixes incorrect documentation of several procedures.
(lib/gs_fonts.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 07:00:28 lpd)
	- The %ram% IODevice was defined, but should not be (it represents a
RAM-based file system, which Ghostscript does not provide). Fix: The type of
the %null% IODevice was /FileSystem rather than /Special. (ziodev2.c [1.2]:
2000/03/10 07:02:07 lpd)
	- Directly-loaded TrueType fonts (including embedded TrueType fonts
in PDF files) could get confused with each other in the cache, because their
XUIDs were based on the font checksum field, which some fonts don't have set
correctly. (lib/gs_ttf.ps [1.3]: 2000/03/16 07:38:07 lpd)

Adds a new example file, a 3-D synthetic image. (examples/doretree.ps [1.1]:
2000/03/10 04:00:45 lpd)

Adds implementations of the devforall, devstatus, and diskonline
compatibility operators. (lib/gs_statd.ps [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:01:55 lpd)

Some Adobe CIDFonts include a line /Setup /cid_Setup load def that
apparently is intended only to prevent the fonts from being loaded by a
standard PostScript interpreter (as opposed to ATM or a special font
loader), since cid_Setup is not defined anywhere and Setup is never
referenced; this change adds a dummy definition of cid_Setup to work around
this. (lib/gs_cidfn.ps [1.3]: 2000/03/10 04:53:25 lpd)

Updates the version # to 6.01, and the version date. (lib/gs_init.ps [1.2]:
2000/03/10 17:18:29 lpd)

Changes the default undercolor removal and black generation functions back
from f(k) = k to f(k) = 0. This fixes some, but not all, of the reported
problems with color inkjet output in 6.0. (lib/gs_init.ps [1.3]: 2000/03/10
18:47:31 lpd)

On Windows, puts stdout into binary mode as well as stdin, to allow piping
printer output through stdout (not a good idea, but it should be supported
as well as on other platforms). (dwmainc.cpp [1.2]: 2000/03/17 06:22:59 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 Streams"></a>Streams</h2><pre>

Changes the sbuf_min_left macro to a procedure for readability and in
preparation for later revision. (stream.c [1.2], stream.h [1.2]: 2000/03/10
03:40:13 lpd)

</pre><h2><a name="6.01 Library"></a>Library</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- (%os%) currentdevparams didn't return (fixed) values for
InitializeAction, Mounted, Removable, Searchable, SearchOrder, and
Writeable, or (meaningful) values for BlockSize, Free, and LogicalSize.
Currently, the latter values are dummies. (gsiodev.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10
03:43:06 lpd)
	- The terminating $ on the $Id: line in gsmalloc.c was missing, and
dwuninst.rc lacked a $Id: line. (gsmalloc.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:44:33 lpd)
	- RasterOps with source transparency = 0, texture transparency = 1
didn't match the (very peculiar) H-P specification even if
TRANSPARENCY_PER_H_P was defined. (gdevdrop.c [1.2], gdevmrop.h [1.2],
gsropt.h [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:06:15 lpd)
	- The prototype for gs_exit() was not included even though gs_exit()
was called. Fix: A cast discarded const unnecessarily. (gsalloc.c [1.2]:
2000/03/10 04:08:23 lpd)
	- The type of the %pipe% IODevice was /FileSystem, whereas it should
be /Special. (gdevpipe.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:13:57 lpd)
	- An incorrectly formatted procedure couldn't be converted correctly
by ansi2knr. (gxidata.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 04:30:58 lpd)
	- The check for a show within a cshow procedure for a CID font was
wrong. Fix: Character widths in CIDFontType 0 fonts were ignored (!). Adds a
.glyphwidth operator to support correct handling of character widths for CID
fonts. Adds a glyphwidth procedure to the library, like glyphshow and
glyphpath, in order to support correct handling of widths for CID fonts.
(gschar.c [1.2], gschar.h [1.2], gstext.c [1.2], gstext.h [1.2]: 2000/03/10
04:41:47 lpd)
	- The description of the value returned by code_map_decode_next in
*pchr was incorrect. (documentation bug only) (gsfcmap.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10
07:03:09 lpd)
	- Fixes a problem producing too much black in the output; also adds
support for 5 new printers (H-P Color DeskJet 690, H-P DesignJet 750, and
Epson Stylus Color 200). Note that this is user-contributed code.
(gsargs.h [1.2]: 2000/03/16 02:01:36 lpd)
	- The code for Axial shadings incorrectly assumed that if the
shading axis was horizontal or vertical in user space, it was also
horizontal or vertical in device space: this caused incorrect results when
the CTM wasn't orthogonal. (gxshade1.c [1.2]: 2000/03/17 08:17:55 lpd)
	- For printer devices, a non-null definition for OutputFile was
required even on platforms that had a default printer (as implemented by
gp_open_printer for that platform). (gp.h [1.2], gsdevice.c [1.2]:
2000/03/18 01:45:16 lpd)

Clears the glyf and loca offsets in TrueType fonts that lack these tables,
so that clients who care can tell whether the font is being downloaded
incrementally. (gstype42.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10 03:45:29 lpd)

Changes a few macro definitions to work around over-zealous compiler
warnings. (gstype1.c [1.2], gstype2.c [1.2], gxtype1.h [1.2]: 2000/03/10
04:29:37 lpd)

Changes the default undercolor removal and black generation functions back
from f(k) = k to f(k) = 0. This fixes some, but not all, of the reported
problems with color inkjet output in 6.0. (gxdcconv.c [1.2]: 2000/03/10
18:47:31 lpd)

<h1><a name="Version6.0"></a>Version 6.0 (2000-02-03)</h1>

This is the first public release since 5.50.  See <a href="Current.htm">the
release summary</a> for information about new capabilities and known
problems.

<h2><a name="6.0_Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

Documents the fact that the plane_depths of a gx_image_enum structure may
vary, and that planes_wanted procedure of a gx_image_enum must return false
if the depths *or* widths can change.  (gxiparam.h)

only be changed by a call of plane_data that provides data for that plane.
(gxiparam.h)

Documents the change in the handling of the pthreads library.
(doc/Make.htm)

Documents the fact that setting parameters for the DCTEncode filter in
ps2pdf causes a crash.  (doc/Ps2pdf.htm)

Documents another bug in the MIPSpro 7.x / IRIX 6.5.x compilers, with
isave.c.  (doc/Make.htm)

Corrects Russell Lang's e-mail address.  (doc/New-user.htm)

Documents the new image operator test file and the pdfeof file.
(doc/Psfiles.htm)

man/ps2pdfwr.1, man/gsnd.1, man/pf2afm.1, man/ps2pdf.1)

<h2><a name="6.0_Procedures"></a>Procedures</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- Building on BSDI didn't work.  The simplest way to fix this was to
change the linking of the pthreads library on Unix platforms to be included
in STDLIBS rather than the "sync" implementation. (fix contributed by a
user) (lib.mak, unix-gcc.mak, unixansi.mak, unixtrad.mak)
	- Once again, some runtime files weren't installed.  (unixinst.mak)
	- Building the self-extracting executable didn't work.  (winint.mak)

Updates the user-contributed all-architectures makefile.  (all-arch.mak)

<h2><a name="6.0_Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- A needed #include was missing.  (geninit.c)
	- There were signed/unsigned char mismatches.  (genht.c, geninit.c)
	- The MacOS compiler imposes a 32K limit on the size of a stack
frame: we changed the code to use malloc/free.  (geninit.c)

Removes an unnecessary variable.  (echogs.c)

Adds a file that attempts to test the image operators exhaustively.
(lib/image-qa.ps, unixinst.mak)

Enhances the prfont.ps utility to print CIDFonts.  (lib/prfont.ps)

Adds a utility file that patches the PDF interpreter to allow garbage after
the %%EOF (or the %%EOF to be missing completely).  (lib/pdfeof.ps)

<h2><a name="6.0_Drivers"></a>Drivers</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- The X driver compared too many bits of color value, leading to
unnecessary halftoning.  (bug introduced by a fix in 5.99) (gdevxcmp.c)
	- Output from the pswrite driver got a dictfull error on Level 1
printers.  (gdevps.c)
	- Anti-aliasing had stopped working on MS Windows and OS/2. (bug
probably introduced in 5.65) (gdevmswn.c, gdevpm.c)

<h2><a name="6.0_Platforms"></a>Platforms</h2>

Adds a conditional definition of PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED for old versions of
the pthreads library.  (gp_psync.c)

Updates the Microsoft Visual C++ library makefile for VC++ 6.  (msvclib.mak)

Updates some copyright dates.  (winint.mak, dwsetup.rc)

<h2><a name="6.0_Fonts"></a>Fonts</h2>

Updates the URW fonts to include the expanded Adobe character set, including
many Eastern European accented characters.  (doc/New-user.htm)

Removes a 'readonly' that inconvenienced the authors of ttf2pf.
(lib/gs_ttf.ps)

<h2><a name="6.0_PDF_writer"></a>PDF writer</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- The Dest key was deleted from GoTo and GoToR link annotation
pdfmarks.  (gdevpdfm.c)
	- {name} references were substituted even in stream data for the
/PUT pdfmark.  (gdevpdfm.c)
	- The revision number was sometimes printed incorrectly if its
fraction part was zero.  (gdevpdf.c)
	- Embedded Multiple Master font instances weren't identified as
MMType1 rather than Type1.  (gdevpdff.h, gdevpdff.c, gdevpdft.c, gdevpdfw.c)
	- The test against MaxSubsetPct was incorrect when the percentages
were equal.  (gdevpdfw.c)
	- Font registrations weren't removed when the device was closed.
(gdevpdff.h, gdevpdfx.h, gdevpdff.c, gdevpdfw.c)
	- Multiple /OBJ pdfmarks with the same name caused an error.  For
Distiller compatibility, we now allow this if the type is the same, even
though the pdfmark specification doesn't say anything about this being
legal.  (gdevpdfm.c)

Removes an unnecessary variable.  (gdevpdff.c, gdevpdfr.c)

Disables embedding Multiple Master font instances, since Acrobat Reader
doesn't accept what appear to be correct output and we don't have time
before the release to track down the problem.  (gdevpdft.c)

<h2><a name="6.0_Interpreter_PDF"></a>Interpreter (PDF)</h2>

Factors some code to allow patching the PDF reader to allow garbage after
the %%EOF (or the %%EOF to be missing completely).  (lib/pdf_main.ps)

<h2><a name="6.0_Interpreter"></a>Interpreter</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- Type 1 fonts with non-standard OtherSubrs had stopped working.
(bug introduced since 5.60) (zchar1.c)
	- usecmap didn't work.  (lib/gs_cmap.ps)
	- The glyph_info procedure for Type 1 fonts didn't take Metrics[2]
or CDevProc into account.  (zchar1.c, zfont1.c)
	- The multiple-data-source case of images was broken. (bug
introduced in 5.99) (zimage.c)
	- If a page device Install procedure caused an error, things could
be left in an inconsistent state.  (lib/gs_setpd.ps)
	- Using a DeviceN color space could access uninitialized data in a
color value.  (zcsdevn.c)
	- DeviceN images with procedure data sources were broken.
(zimage.c)
	- Images with a procedure data source could terminate prematurely if
their processing was interrupted.  (zimage.c)
	- The garbage collector only marked half the name table sub-tables,
and attempted to mark an equal number of invalid pointers, leading to
invalid accesses or memory corruption.  (iname.c)

Removes an unused variable.  (zmisc.c)

<h2><a name="6.0_Streams"></a>Streams</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- sgets didn't reset the cursor pointers, so sgets into a client
buffer followed by sseek (for some kinds of streams, including files) could
get confused.  (stream.c)

<h2><a name="6.0_Library"></a>Library</h2>

Fixes problems:
	- A 'const' qualifier was omitted, leading to a type mismatch.
(gxclrast.c)
	- The revision number was sometimes printed incorrectly if its
fraction part was zero.  (gsmisc.c)
	- gs_image_next returned the wrong value in *pused if it incremented
the plane number.  (bug introduced in 5.99) (gsimage.c)
	- Only the last of the data_x and raster values in the local
'planes' array in gs_image_next_planes were initialized.  (bug introduced in
5.99) (gsimage.c)
	- The multiple-data-source case of images was broken. (bug
introduced in 5.99) (gsimage.h, gsimage.c)
	- ImageType 3 images with unequal scaling for the mask and data
didn't work.  (We thought they once did, but it appears they never have.)
(gximage3.c)
	- Images with 12-bit samples treated a Decode entry of [1 0] the
same as [0 1].  (Other, general Decode entries worked correctly.)
(gxipixel.c)
	- ImageType 3 images didn't work if processing was ever interrupted
for remapping a color.  (gximage3.c)
	- Images in DeviceN color spaces with 12-bit samples didn't work.
(gxi12bit.c, gxidata.c)
	- Images in DeviceN color spaces could fail to render properly
because the interruption of rendering left a half-built entry in an internal
cache.  (gxi12bit.c, gxicolor.c)
	- Images with non-idempotent RasterOps in 1-component DeviceN color
spaces didn't render properly, because the same pixel was rendered multiple
times after a color remapping interruption.  (gximono.c)
	- The fast case of masked images caused a crash if invoked without
an imager state.  (gximono.c)
	- Flushing buffered image data could cause coordinate bookkeeping
to get out of sync.  (gxidata.c)
	- ImageType 3, InterleaveType 2 images sometimes failed to render
the last row.  (gximage3.c)
	- The fix in 5.88 for resizing large objects had a bug itself.
(gsalloc.c)
	- Whan banding, if a client supplied more data than necessary for an
image, the client was told (incorrectly) that all of the data was used.
(fix from Artifex) (gxclimag.c)
	- Null patterns caused a crash. (bug probably introduced by changes
to support PatternType 2) (gspcolor.c)
	- On hand-initialized memory devices where line_ptrs[0] != base,
monobit RasterOps could cause invalid or stray memory accesses.  (gdevmr1.c)

Removes an unnecessary variable.  (gdevppla.c, gsfont.c)

Adds the ability to call a specified procedure when unregistering
notification, needed for removing PDF font registrations.  (gsnotify.h,
gsnotify.c)

Updates the copyright year.  (gscdef.c)
