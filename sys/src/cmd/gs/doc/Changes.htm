<h2><a name="7.04-Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><pre>

Fixes problems:
	- Improve security in a (mostly) backward compatible fashion adding
more flexible file access paths (PermitFile...) as user paramters and adding
the facility to return to NOSAFER mode after running jobs (files/procedures)
in SAFER mode. Also adds a -dPARANOIDSAFER command line option that only
allows reading files from %stdin, paths specified on LIBPATH, FONTPATH and
/GenericResourceDir or /FontResourceDir. Improve security for device related
access to the file system and to pipes by allowing the dangerous parameters
to be locked (for example, OutputFile). The locking is performed after
command line parameters are established. This should address SF bug #474582
and eliminate the need for the RedHat PARANOIDSAFER patch.
(doc/Language.htm [1.34.2.1], doc/Use.htm [1.33.2.1]: 2002/01/25 06:33:08

Removes the admonishment to update PVERSION and JVERSION from the Makefile
documentation. The build dependencies were removed earlier to reduce user
confusion; they're currently vestigial in expectation of future build
requirements. This is the second half of the fix for sf bug #457838.

Documents the work-around of using '#' instead of '=' to separate command
line options from their arguments. The was previously listed only as a quirk
of the Wacom build on MS-DOS, but is also needed on win32 because the
command shell treats '=' as whitespace in passing arguments to batch files
(like ps2pdf.bat). Closes SourceForge bug #483066. Also documents that
MS-DOS is no longer a supported operating system. (doc/Use.htm [1.33.2.4]:

Fixes problems:
	- the icclib makefile comments were out of date; the build rule
referred to gs_stdio_h, which no longer exists; the build rule for gsicc.o
referred to icc_h, which was not defined at that point. patch originally by
lpd, propagated from the development branch. (gs.mak [1.5.2.1],
icclib.mak [1.3.2.1], lib.mak [1.53.2.1]: 2001/10/26 00:15:30 giles)
	- Fix for #474544. Corrects inability to convert valid DeviceN tint
transform functions into type 4 functions. Valid operator names were not
being recognized unless the tint transform function had been bound. One of
two fixes required for this problem. Customer #710. (int.mak [1.50.2.1]:

	- Fix for #474544. This is the second of two fixes required for this
problem. This fix creates a type 0 function which implements a "color cube"
for those tint transform functions which cannot be converted into a type 4
function. Customer #710. Note: There is one more revision planned for this
effort. This revision will make the buildcolorcube operator into a more
general buildsampledfunction. This will allow its use in other situations.
