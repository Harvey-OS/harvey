<p>
Before using this form, please read the <a
href="Bug-info.htm">instructions</a> for reporting problems. If you are
running a developer or beta version of Ghostscript, and you are an
experienced tester (for example, if you have been testing Ghostscript since
before January 1, 2000, or you have already submitted at least two problem
reports that we accepted for investigation), you can send an informal report
to the place indicated below. Otherwise, please fill out this form
completely. Fill out <strong>all</strong> applicable items in this form.

<p>
Most importantly, you <strong>must</strong> include all data (PostScript files,
PDF files, batch/script files, and/or fonts) required to reproduce the problem,
either
by giving a URL from which we can download the data, or by including the
data with the report itself. If you don't include this information, we can't
investigate the problem. Please note that the bug reports are publicly
archived, so the information you provide will be generally available. If the
test data absolutely must remain confidential, please so indicate on the form
below and provide an address we may contact privately for the file. 

<p>
Once you have prepared the report, if you are reporting a problem in a
stable release of AFPL Ghostscript, and you do not need to attach any files
to the report, go to <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&amp;group_id=1897" 
class="offsite">http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&amp;group_id=1897</a>
and follow the instructions there.  Use the completed problem reporting form as
the body of the Bug Tracker submission.  Otherwise (i.e., if you are reporting
a problem in a developer or beta fileset, or you need to attach files to the report),
e-mail the form, with any attached files, as follows:

<ul>

<li>If the problem is in a developer fileset, mail to <a
href="mailto:bug-gs-dev@ghostscript.com">bug-gs-dev@ghostscript.com</a>.

<li>If the problem is in a beta fileset, mail to <a
href="mailto:bug-gs-beta@ghostscript.com">bug-gs-beta@ghostscript.com</a>.

<li>Otherwise (the problem is in a stable fileset):

<ul>

<li>If you are running MS-DOS, MS Windows, or OS/2, and you are reasonably
sure that the problem is specific to your platform, mail to <a
href="mailto:bug-gswin@ghostscript.com">bug-gswin@ghostscript.com</a>.

<li>If you are running MacOS, and you are reasonably sure that the problem
is specific to the Mac, mail to <a
href="mailto:mac-gs-bugs@ghostscript.com">mac-gs-bugs@ghostscript.com</a>.

<li>Otherwise, mail to <a
href="mailto:bug-gs@ghostscript.com">bug-gs@ghostscript.com</a>.

</ul>

</ul>

advance.
