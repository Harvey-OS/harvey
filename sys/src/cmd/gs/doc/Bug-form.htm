<p>
Before using this form, please read the <a
href="Bug-info.htm">instructions</a> for reporting problems. If you are
running a developer or beta version of Ghostscript, and you are an
experienced tester (for example, if you have been testing Ghostscript
for more than a year, or you have already submitted at least two problem
reports that we accepted for investigation), you can send an informal report
to the place indicated below. Otherwise, please fill out this form
completely. Fill out <strong>all</strong> applicable items in this form.

<p>
Most importantly, you <strong>must</strong> include all data (PostScript files,
PDF files, batch/script files, and/or fonts) required to reproduce the problem,
either
by giving a URL from which we can download the data, or by including the
data with the report itself. If you don't include this information, we can't
investigate the problem. Please note that the bug reports are publicly
archived, so the information you provide will be generally available. If the
test data absolutely must remain confidential, please so indicate on the form
below and provide an address we may contact privately for the file. 

<p>
Once you have prepared the report, go to <a
href="http://bugs.ghostscript.com" 
class="offsite">http://bugs.ghostscript.com</a>. 
and follow the instructions there. Data files can be attached to the 
bug report after the bug is submitted. 
Use the completed problem reporting form as 
the body of the Bugzilla submission. If by some reason the Bugzilla doesn't
work for you, bugs can be submitted as follows:

<ul>

<li>If you are running MS-DOS, MS Windows, or OS/2, and you are reasonably
sure that the problem is specific to your platform, mail to <a
href="mailto:bug-gswin@ghostscript.com">bug-gswin@ghostscript.com</a>.

<li>If you are running MacOS, and you are reasonably sure that the problem
is specific to the Mac, mail to <a
href="mailto:mac-gs@ghostscript.com">mac-gs@ghostscript.com</a>.

<li>Otherwise, mail to <a
href="mailto:bug-gs@ghostscript.com">bug-gs@ghostscript.com</a>.

</ul>

<p>
Fully completed problem reports help us improve Ghostscript.  Thanks in
advance.
