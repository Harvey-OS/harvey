                            Overview of Ghostscript

   This document is a roadmap to the Ghostscript documentation. After
   looking through it, if you want to install Ghostscript and not only
   use it, we recommend you read how to install Ghostscript, and how to
   compile Ghostscript from source code (which is necessary before
   installing it on Unix and VMS systems).

Document roadmap by theme

  What should I read if I'm a new user?

     * how to use Ghostscript. This includes both a quickstart
       introduction to the commandline version and more extensive
       reference material.
     * detailed information about specific devices that Ghostscript can
       use for output
     * information about reporting problems--but remember that
       Ghostscript comes with NO WARRANTY and NO SUPPORT
     * more detailed information about how to use Ghostscript under Unix
       with lpr as a filter for printing

  AFPL Ghostscript and GPL Ghostscript

   AFPL Ghostscript and GPL Ghostscript are different releases. If you
   have AFPL Ghostscript, not the GPL Ghostscript releases, you should
   read (or at least skim through):
     * additional information about AFPL Ghostscript releases that is not
       relevant to GPL Ghostscript releases.

   If you run into any questions, or if you are going to be using
   Ghostscript extensively, you should at least skim, and probably
   eventually read:
     * about the fonts distributed with Ghostscript, including how to add
       or replace fonts
     * a description of the Ghostscript language, and its differences
       from the documented PostScript language
     * about the postscript files distributed with Ghostscript (other
       than fonts)

  Before building Ghostscript

   If you are going to compile Ghostscript from source, rather than just
   use an executable you got from somewhere, you may want to read:
     * how to build Ghostscript and install it
     _________________________________________________________________

What should I read if I'm not a new user?

   If you have already used Ghostscript, when you receive a new release
   you should begin by reading this file, then
     * News.htm, for incompatible changes and new features in the current
       release;
     * if you wish, Changes.htm, for a detailed list of changes in the
       current release;
     * if you wish, History#.htm (currently History8.htm), for changes in
       other releases.
     _________________________________________________________________

What if I'm a developer?

   If you are going to do any development on or with Ghostscript at all,
   you should at least look at
     * the roadmap documentation for Ghostscript's source files and
       architecture

   If you are going to write a new driver for Ghostscript, you should
   read
     * the guide to the Ghostscript source code
     * the interface between Ghostscript and device drivers
     * about the external font interface between Ghostscript and
       platform-supplied fonts

   If you are considering distributing Ghostscript (either AFPL or GPL
   versions) in conjunction with a commercial product, you should read
   the license carefully, and you should also read
     * additional clarification of the circumstances under which
       Ghostscript can be distributed with a commercial product

   If you intend to use Ghostscript in the form of a dynamic link library
   (DLL) under OS/2 or Microsoft Windows or in the form of shared object
   under Linux, read
     * documentation on Ghostscript Interpreter API

   If you want to use Ghostscript as part of another program--as a
   callable PostScript language interpreter--and not as a DLL or as a
   self-contained executable application, you should begin by reading
     * the source file imain.h, the documented API for Ghostscript not as
       a DLL

   or if you are going to use only the Ghostscript graphics library,
     * about the structure of the Ghostscript library and its interfaces
     _________________________________________________________________

What if I'm writing documentation?

   If you are editing or adding to Ghostscript's existing documentation
   in HTML format, or writing a new document, you should read
     * the coding and style guidelines for Ghostscript's HTML-based
       documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

Presence on the World Wide Web

  Ghostscript's home page

   Ghostscript has a home page on the World Wide Web with helpful
   information such as the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and a list of
   known problems and workarounds for the current AFPL Ghostscript
   release (in the "Obtaining" file for that release):

     http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

   More material about Ghostscript can be found at

     http://www.ghostscript.com/

  Adobe PostScript, Encapsulated PostScript, and PDF reference documentation

   Adobe makes a wealth of technical documentation available over the
   Web, including the PostScript Language Reference Manual (Third
   Edition); the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) Format Specification
   version 3, including Encapsulated PostScript Interchange (EPSI)
   format; the PDF Reference manuals. The Acrobat SDK contains pdfmark
   and Acrobat Distiller parameters documentation. Some of these
   documents are also available at Adobe's ftp site, but not necessarily
   under the same filenames.

  Other material on the WWW

   Much other material about Ghostscript is available on the World Wide
   Web, both as web pages and as archived Usenet and mailing list
   discussions. Use the well-known search engines to find such material.

   There is a translation of the Ghostscript 'man' pages into Czech at:
