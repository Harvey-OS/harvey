This file, current.doc, describes problems and new features in the current
release of Ghostscript.  This file describes version 3.23 of Ghostscript.

For an overview of Ghostscript and a list of the documentation files, see
README.

New features (since release 3.0)
============

Note: this is not a complete list of new features.  See the NEWS file for
full details.

Implements all remaining significant Level 2 features: halftone
TransferFunction, setpagedevice (subset), XStep/YStep for Patterns,
Interpolate for images, AccurateScreens (limited implementation).

Provides PageSize, Margins, .HWMargins, and ImagingBBox device parameters,
which allow complete control over the size and positioning of images on
printers.

Implements a new psmono device, replacing the ps2image utility.

Supports many new 800x600x16 SuperVGA displays.  See use.doc for details.

Adds a -dFAKEFONTS switch that makes fake entries in FontDirectory for
unloaded fonts, for the benefit of programs that think they can find all
the available fonts by scanning FontDirectory.

Adds the Canon BJ-200 and H-P LaserJet 4 drivers to most makefiles.

Adds a -dWindowID= switch (for X Windows) that allows specifying the window
to which output should be directed.

Known problems
==============

Usage
-----

On a MS-DOS system, interrupting the interpreter by typing ^C doesn't
restore the display mode.

Limitations
-----------

serialnumber returns the same value in all copies.

The realtime operator is not implemented.

User names (a Display PostScript facility) are not implemented.

Some floating point exceptions terminate the interpreter, rather than
producing a limitcheck error.

The DCTEncode filter disregards the Blend parameter, and uses different
QuantTables and HuffTables from Adobe's.

The DCT filters do not support nonintegral sample ratios, and do not allow
Sum(HS*VS)>10, regardless of the value of the Relax parameter.

The size of the execution stack cannot be changed dynamically.  (However,
the sizes of the operand and dictionary stacks can be changed.)

Separation color spaces are implemented, but devices that actually produce
color separations are not supported.  The special color separations All and
None, and the primary separations (Red, Green, etc.), are not supported.

execform and ucache are implemented, but they do not actually do any
caching; setucacheparams and ucachestatus are dummies.  (This only impacts
performance, not functionality.)

setpagedevice and currentpagedevice only look at a fixed, small set of
keys.  See the NEWS file for details.

The image operator only honors the Interpolate flag in the image
dictionary if the combined transformation (ImageMatrix + CTM) doesn't
involve rotation, skewing, or X-reflection.

Graphics bugs
-------------

The implementation only looks at the PaintType of the font when doing
show, not when doing charpath.  Because of this, stroked fonts don't work
correctly with charpath.

arcto gives an error for negative radii.

Opening more than one window device at the same time doesn't work.
This is the case for both X Windows and Microsoft Windows.

setpagedevice affects the driver, not just the current graphics state.
Consequently, restore / grestore / grestoreall / setgstate may not undo
setpagedevice properly.

cshow doesn't work with composite fonts.

Non-graphics bugs
-----------------

The %statementedit pseudo-file is equivalent to %lineedit.  As a
consequence, the interactive interpreter requires that every statement fit
on a line, i.e., you can't have an unpaired (, {, or <.

The following operators that expect arrays won't accept packed arrays:
	definefont (Subrs (type 1 fonts))
	setdash (dash pattern)

Syntax errors occurring within a binary token do not produce the error
message specified by the Adobe documentation.

restore doesn't restore the user parameters.

1 vmreclaim is equivalent to 2 vmreclaim -- there is no separate GC for
local VM.
