/*
 * From the interpreter's point of view, the graphics state is largely opaque,
 * i.e., the interpreter is just another client of the library.
 * The interpreter does require additional items in the graphics state;
 * these are "client data" from the library's point of view.
 * Most of the complexity in this added state comes from
 * the parameters associated with the various Level 2 color spaces.
 * Note that the added information consists entirely of refs.
 */

/*
 * The interpreter represents graphics state objects in a slightly
 * unnatural way, namely, by a t_astruct ref that points to an object
 * of type st_igstate_obj, which is essentially a t_struct ref that in turn
 * points to a real graphics state (object of type st_gs_state).
 * We do this so that save and restore can manipulate the intermediate
 * object and not have to worry about copying entire gs_states.
 *
 * Because a number of different operators must test whether an object
 * is a gstate, we make an exception to our convention of declaring
 * structure descriptors only in the place where the structure itself
 * is defined (see gsstruct.h for more information on this).
