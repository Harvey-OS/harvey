	Many versions of Ghostscript, including all versions created before
June 1993, are customarily distributed with a license called the GNU
General Public License; in these versions, a file named COPYING contains a
copy of the license.  This copy of Ghostscript is governed not by the GNU
License, but by a substantially different license in a similar spirit, the
Aladdin Ghostscript Free Public License; the file PUBLIC contains a copy of
this license.
