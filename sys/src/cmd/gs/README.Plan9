Aladdin Ghostscript has been licensed to be included with the
release of Plan 9.  Minor changes were made to the sources to
accommodate a couple of restrictions in the APE library and to
produce Plan 9 output formats.  These changes are all conditioned
by
	#ifdef	Plan9
and were made in December, 1994.  As well, the build was rearranged
to be driven by a Plan 9 mkfile.
