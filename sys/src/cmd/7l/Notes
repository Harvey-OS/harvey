-	W or X suffix instead of register type? currently W and none,
-	internal .W as size flag? not always simple flag, though. sometimes other constraints. eg, LDAR
-	sign-extension for 32->64 in 64-bit ops as optimisation
	
-	D_ADDR for relocation
-	ADR and ADRP parameters? LO12(label)?

-	C_BAUTO	unsigned constant 12 bits 0 - 4095
	C_UAUTO8K	halfword aligned, 12 bits	0 to 8190
	C_UAUTO16K	32-bit aligned, 12 bits	0 to 16380
	C_UAUTO32K	64-bit aligned, 12 bits	0 to 32760
	C_UAUTO64K 128-bit aligned, 12 bits	0 to 65520

	C_TAUTO	-256 to 255, unscaled, 9 bits
	C_PAUTO	-512 to 504	for 7 bit field for 64-bit register pairs, multiple of 8

	also 7 bit signed and scaled for register pair: -256 to 252 (4), -512 to 504 (8)
	similarly for EXT and OREG, ACON, ECON
	UAUTO can't match BAUTO etc because of negative values: need to split ranges

For external addressing:
	ADRP + 12 bit offset
	    ADRP	addr(SB), Rt
	or
	    MOVt	$addr(SB).LO(Rt), Rd
or?
	first N words of SB forms power table for addressing
	MOVW	x(SB), Rt
	MOVt	o(Rt), Rd

p 394: add extended register: Rd = Rn + LSL(extend(Rm), imm3) where imm3 <= 4 ins has (imm3&7)<<10

	width spec: W when option 00x | 010 | 10x | 110
		            X when option x11

	for 32 bits: UXTB, UXTH, LSL|UXTW, UXTX, ...
	LSL form only when at least one of Rd or Rn is WSP; in that case is also default(?)
	otherwise <extend> must be present
	similarly for 64-bit form and SP.
	<amount> is left shift amount in range 0 to 4, optional; default of 0 when <ext


Add extended, immediate, shifted register
	- LSR 0, LSR 1 ASR 2; shift 0 to 31/63 in imm6 Rd = Rn + shift(Rm, amount)

The logical immediate instructions accept a bitmask immediate bimm32 or bimm64. Such an immediate consists
EITHER of a single consecutive sequence with at least one non-zero bit, and at least one zero bit, within an
element of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits; the element then being replicated across the register width, or the bitwise
inverse of such a value. The immediate values of all-zero and all-ones may not be encoded as a bitmask
immediate, so an assembler must either generate an error for a logical instruction with such an immediate, or a
programmer-friendly assembler may transform it into some other instruction which achieves the intended result.

Need 32-bit versions of load signed byte/halfword instructions?
