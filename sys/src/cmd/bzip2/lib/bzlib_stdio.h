   ~~~~~~~
   0.9.0 -- original version.

   0.9.0a/b -- no changes in this file.

      * fixed bzWrite/bzRead to ignore zero-length requests.
      * fixed bzread to correctly handle read requests after EOF.
      * wrong parameter order in call to bzDecompressInit in
        bzBuffToBuffDecompress.  Fixed.
