Here are some ideas for ways to improve the current distribution:

* Support the switch-to-editor feature.

* Make web2c handle fields correctly, i.e., to put the field identifier
in the symbol table of the type, instead of the global symbol table. 
This would simplify the GFtoDVI change file a fair amount.

* Make web2c handle variant records.  This would make the TeX, Metafont,
and GFtoDVI change files all simpler.

* Make DVItype output to stdout, and not do a dialog, a la GFtype.

* Make the X11 support for Metafont more robust.  Communicate the sizes
back and forth between Metafont and X.  Handle Expose events.  Use the
toolkit, instead of Xlib.

* When files aren't found, use perror, instead of just saying `not
found'.  Some programs don't even say what file it is that wasn't found
right now!

* Handle filenames more consistently.  If all filenames were Pascal
strings (i.e., with a leading blank, and terminated with a blank), it
might easier to understand.

* Rewrite test_access to take a string argument for the name of the
file. (Done, in ./fontutils. Now, the other programs have to be changed
to use it.)  Having it take it from a global (cur_name) is ugly.  Also,
GFtoDVI has a variable named cur_name (which is something else), so the
change file has to hack around that.

* Put all the repeated code in the various extra files and combine it
into one place.  Ditto for the .h files.  Ditto for the .defines files.
This would be probably be the biggest boon to people working on this
distribution in the future.
