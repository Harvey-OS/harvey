This directory contains the programs that convert the original web
sources to C.

The convert shell script is the thing that actually gets invoked from
the Makefile.  It runs web2c, fixwrites, and splitup in turn, plus
various sed nonsense.  web2c parses Pascal and outputs C; fixwrites
shouldn't be necessary, it converts multiple-argument writes into C;
splitup splits the output file into pieces for the sake of broken
compilers.

To define a new symbol (e.g., a function) to be used in the change
files, it's necessary to add it to texmf.defines (if it's only used in
TeX/MF/MP) or common.defines (otherwise) here, as well as making the
actual definition.  New functions in the libraryshould be declared
somewhere, probably cpascal.h.  Of course no underscores are allowed,
since tangle removes them.
