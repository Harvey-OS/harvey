# This file makes an archive file consisting of the window support for
# all the devices.  To make Metafont support another device, just add a
# file here, and the obvious declarations in ../extra.c (the device
# support is the last section in that file).
# 
# By making the result into an archive file, the final binary has only
# the devices which are actually desired, thus saving some small amount
# of time and space.
