Here is the list of configurations that have passed the trip and trap tests.
See also ./PROBLEMS.

Except as otherwise noted:
* ANSI is not defined
* SIXTEENBIT is not defined
* REGFIX is either defined or irrelevant
* optimization is maximally turned on.

``32-bit TeX'' means with bigtex.diff and bigmf.diff applied, and with
glue_ratio changed to double, as site.h and README suggest.  ``16-bit
TeX'' means with glue_ratio defined to be float.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
DEC 3100				cc 3.1		mackay

HP9000		HP-UX 6.5		gcc 1.37	spqr

i386		386/ix 2.0.2		gcc 1.37	karl

Masscomp 5600	RTU 4.1A		cc		spqr
	But pltotf and dvitype don't work.

Microvax II	Ultrix-32 3.1		cc		karl

MIPS/2000	RISC/os 4.01            cc 2.0		lgy
	For systype=bsd43 or systype=sysv.  -O1 works, but -O2 doesn't.

Sequent Symmetry Dynix 3.0.12		cc		morgan
	cc -O fails on mf/x11.c: just compile that without -O.

Sun 2	SunOS 3.2 and 3.4 		cc		mackay
        long lines in mf2.c and mf4.c break the compiler.  Simple
	editing corrects this.  Oversize case statements in gvtodvi.c
	and vftovp.c cause yacc errors.  See ./PROBLEMS.
        Otherwise works, even with -O.
