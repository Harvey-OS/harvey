Mon Apr 13 09:00:39 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@hayley)

Fri Jan  3 13:20:09 1992  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * texware/pltotf.ch (main block): exit 0.  No, rescind that; the

          otherwise we get `undefined control' from hc.

        * configure (systemtypes): fix sed commands to remove the final .h.

Sat Aug 10 12:23:24 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * common/texmf.c: put the memory_word stuff back in `texmfmem.h',

        * common/{fileio,texmf}.c [FUNNNY_CORE_DUMP}: don't do the funny
          core dump stuff if we're BibTeX (from elisabet@max.u.washington.edu).

        * README (Changing constants): document this.

        * Makefile (install-formats, install-bases): do `install dir1/file
          dir2/file' instead of `install dir1/file dir2', since Ultrix
          install is broken (in yet another way)  (from
          scole@doorstop.berkeley.edu).

        * man/{pktogf,pktype,vftovp,gftodvi,gftopk,gftype,tftopl}.man:
          document that we look in `.' first.

Sat Jun 29 08:14:12 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

          string.

        * common/texmf.c (get_date_and_time): use `time_t' instead of
          `long' for `time's return type.

        * bibtex/bibtex.ch: comment out hacks to do the setjmp/longjmp.
        * bibtex/convert: don't put in the setjmp/longjmp.

        * Makefile (CCLD): new command to do the link step (suggested by
          herber@fnalf.fnal.gov).  Change */Makefile to use it, and the
          makeargs variable to pass it down.

        * {mf,tex,mfware}/memory.h: rename this, to include conflicts with
          a system <memory.h>.  (from newton@gumby.cs.caltech.edu).

        * common/texmf.c [HANDLE_INTERRUPTS]: remove this conditional,
          since we unconditionally defined it, anyway.

        * site.h-dist (schar) [ANSI]: change conditional to use __STDC__.

Sun Jun  9 12:27:01 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * tex/ctex.ch: apply trie.diff; we'll always have a big
          hyphenation trie, instead of requiring the installer to patch
          it.

Wed May  8 07:31:19 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * Makefile (stamp-{bases,formats}): make dependent on ini{mf,tex}.

        * mfware/gftodvi.ch: change default extension to `2602gf',
          following dek's change for art.

        * tex/ctex.ch: we're now at version 3.14.
        (Also new versions of gftodvi.web and mf.web, but they don't
        require any changes to the change files.)

Mon Jan 14 09:28:20 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * mf/Makefile (inimf): don't depend on $(windowlib), and don't
          link with $(libs); it just wastes disk space.
        * common/texmf.c [INI]: undefine all window symbols.

        * man/dvitype.man: fix mismatched parentheses.

        * man/tftopl.man: document the new option and the path searching.

        * common/extra.c (make_c_string): replace spurious call to
          `space_terminate' with `null_terminate'.

        * texware/tftopl.ch: changes to implement -verbose; also write to
          stdout if no output file is specified; also call set_paths
          to do path searching for the TFM file.

        * texware/pltotf.ch (usage): remove; just print it inline.

Sun Jan 13 16:57:01 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        distribution.

        * {tex,mf}/Makefile ({tex,mf}-extra.o): make a link to $(extrac)
          and compile it, instead of compiling $(extrac), so that parallel
          computation work properly.

        * tex/Makefile (latex.fmt, slitex.fmt): the files are called
          `lplain' and `splain' again, instead of `lplain3' and `splain3'.

        * man/mf.man: document this.

        * Version 5.0e.

Thu Apr 12 21:33:41 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* tex/extra.c (calledit): do not xor with 0x80 (from
	ekrell@ulysses.att.com).

Fri Apr  6 20:40:20 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* {tex,mf}/extra.c (zinputln): have to test against 255, not 127.

	* web/Makefile: touch tangle.h (from colin@umist.ac.uk).

Wed Apr  4 16:10:03 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at aten)

	* PROBLEMS: cc and gftodvi/vftovp don't mix.

Thu Mar 29 07:50:15 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 5.0a (with ken's changes to the change files).

Tue Mar 27 08:01:20 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* web2c/web2c.yacc (FUNCTION_HEAD): check for debug before
	printing out the function name.

	* texware/Makefile (pltotf): don't put this on two lines.

Fri Mar 23 18:46:49 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at aten)

	* Version 4.893c.

	* web2c/Makefile: do test ... instead of [ ... ].
        mf/MFwindow/Makefile: use $(SHELL) instead of /bin/sh.

Thu Mar 22 18:20:38 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at aten)

	* texware/dvitypext.c: declare packrealnameoffile to be void, even
	if ANSI is not defined, else Ultrix loses.

Fri Mar  9 08:38:56 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* defaults.h, site.h: move ANSI from the former back to the
        latter, since some systems want it.

	* bibtex/bibtex.ch (int_to_ASCII): use `the_int' instead of `int'
        as the first parameter name; some cc's bomb with `int'.
        (from rusty@garnet.berkeley.edu)

	* texware/dvitypext.c (packrealnameoffile): return type is void.

	* */Makefile (veryclean): remove backup files, core files.
        */Makefile: use $(SHELL) ./<script> instead of ./<script>.
        web/Makefile: define SHELL.
        (mackay@cs.washington.edu supplied these changes.)

Fri Mar  2 17:27:22 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* texware/dvitype.ch: make input be 8 bits, like the rest of the
	programs.

Sun Feb 25 20:36:19 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* {mf,tex}/ini_to_tr[ai]p: save the .h file we're editing.

Thu Feb 22 21:06:49 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* */Makefile: change $(RM) to rm.

	* texware/texware.h: do not cast the result of getc to char, for
	the sake of Ultrix.

Sat Feb 17 07:36:50 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* README: Make the instructions for bootstrapping tangle correct.

	* Makefile (dist): tangleboot.pas is in web, not web2c.

	* {mfware,texware,web,web2c}/Makefile: remove $(CFLAGS) from the
	load lines.

	* bibtex/bibext.c: move conditional on BSD to after #include
	"site.h" (from bsuggs@hac.arpa.com).

	* web2c/Makefile (web2cy.c): do `-if', since one of the commands
	exits with bad status under Ultrix.

Release 4.893b:
* Include patches from Tim to web2c to turn off the verbose output,
  unless -d is supplied to web2c.
* Change $(AR) in the MFwindow Makefile to `ar'.
* Try to get the base file from the program name in Metafont, as well in
  TeX.  Implication: mf.script and tex.script are no longer supplied,
  since a link to plain.{base,fmt} named {mf,tex}.{base,fmt} suffices. 
  `make install' doesn't create these links, since they only need to be
  done once.
* Move some stuff from site.h that should never be changed to a new
  file, defaults.h. Add a new definition, SIGNAL_HANDLER_RETURN_TYPE, to
  site.h, to get rid of the warnings in {tex,mf}/extra.c.
* Use a sed script, contributed by eggert@twinsun.com, instead of the
  awk script, at the beginning of the pipeline.
* Fix an unsigned comparison problem in pltotf, that made cc produce
  infinite ligature loops when converting trip.pl.
* Change threshold in Metafont, and f in tftopl, so broken C compilers
  (like some versions of pcc) don't get confused.
* Port vftovp and vptovf. Move pktogf and pktype to fontutil.
* Allow more than 500 kern pairs in pltotf.
* Change the first parameter to {mf,extra}/extra.c to *filename from
  filename[].
* Use a better hack for the mutually recursive procedures in pltotf et al.,
  from Tor Lillqvist <tml@hemuli.atk.vtt.fi>.

Release 2.993+1.9 = 4.893a:
Sebastian contributed the updates to ctex.ch, tftopl.ch, and pltotf.ch. 
Karl did the cmf.ch update.

Release 3.0:
Brings everything up to the new 8-bit versions.
Almost every file has changed at least somewhat, so I'm not going to
list all the changes.  Here are some highlights:
* char is now 0.255 instead of 0..127 in *.defines.
* `packed' is no longer ignored as part of an identifier (e.g., `packed_trie').
* new Makefiles to make it easier to do the trip/trap test, and with all
  the support programs integrated.
* ctex.ch has a hack to get around trie_op_hash being an array with a
  negative lower bound.
* pltotf.ch has a hack to get around mutually recursive routines.
