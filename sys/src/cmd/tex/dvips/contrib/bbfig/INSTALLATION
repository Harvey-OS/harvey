To install bbfig:

Make the bbfig shell script executable and put it in a suitable
directory.  Put the file bb.ps in that *same* directory.  If this
is not possible or is inconvenient, put bb.ps whereever you please
and edit the shell script to define BBPSDIR.

If you run across a PostScript file that manages to confuse bbfig,
please send it along to me and I'll see if I can figure out what is
going wrong.  Thanks.
