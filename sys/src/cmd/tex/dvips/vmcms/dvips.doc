     DVIPS(1)        TeXware    (13 February 1992)          DVIPS(1)



     NAME
      dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript

     SYNOPSIS
      dvips    [ options ] file[.dvi]

     DESCRIPTION
      The program dvips converts a DVI file file[.dvi] produced by TeX
      (or by some other processor like GFtoDVI) and converts it to
      PostScript, normally sending the result directly to the
      laserprinter.  The DVI file may be specified without the .dvi
      extension.  Fonts used may either be resident in the printer or
      defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `virtual' combination of
      both.  If the MakeTeXPK program is installed, dvips will
      automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that don't
      already exist.

      For more information, see the manual dvips.tex is in the
      TEXINPUTS directory.  The manual can be printed with the
      following commands:  tex dvips dvips dvips -o dvips.ps lpr
      dvips.ps

     OPTIONS
      A summary of command line options can be obtained by running
      dvips without a filename.  For more details refer to dvips.tex.
