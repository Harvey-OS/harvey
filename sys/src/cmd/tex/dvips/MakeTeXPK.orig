#
#   This script file makes a new TeX PK font, because one wasn't
#   found.  Parameters are:
#
#   name dpi bdpi magnification [mode [subdir]]
#
#   `name' is the name of the font, such as `cmr10'.  `dpi' is
#   the resolution the font is needed at.  `bdpi' is the base
#   resolution, useful for figuring out the mode to make the font
#   in.  `magnification' is a string to pass to MF as the
#   magnification.  `mode', if supplied, is the mode to use.
#
#   Note that this file must execute Metafont, and then gftopk,
#   and place the result in the correct location for the PostScript
#   driver to find it subsequently.  If this doesn't work, it will
#   be evident because MF will be invoked over and over again.
#
#   Of course, it needs to be set up for your site.
