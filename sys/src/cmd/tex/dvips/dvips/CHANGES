This is dvips 5.490, a minor update to 5.47.  Please check it out and let
me know of any further changes that should be made for 5.5.

Warning:  the new dvips 5.483 (and later) uses a very different
texps.lpro and different psfonts.map entries for slanted or extended
fonts, even from 5.482.  If you use this on a NeXT, get TeXview 3.0
alpha 7 or later.  In any case, change all entries in your local
psfonts.map file that look like

   rptmr Times-Oblique "/Times-Roman .167 SlantFont"

to just

   rptmr Times-Roman ".167 SlantFont"

Note that we now use the unmodified font name as the second entry,
and the special instructions do not provide a font name.

I also need someone who knows troff to create a new, very short dvips.1
that just points at dvips.tex, and I need someone with VMS to update the
VMS port, and someone with CMS to update if possible the CMS port.

Major new features:  color support, much better paper size support.

New features:

   Note that the color command will accept any PostScript commands,
      including setcmycolor, setrgbcolor, etc.  The actual
      specials recognized are `background <cmds>', `color push <cmds>',
      `color pop', and `color <cmds>'.
   The -a option will reduce the memory requirements,
      especially at high resolutions, but it will run slower.
   Added papersize= special, papersize support in config file
   Added horizontal, vertical offsets for output
   Added %DVIPSSection comments
   If -p or -l options have argument preceded by =, then the page
      numbers are treated as sequence rather than count0 values.
   Added optional clipping to epsf inclusion
   Allow popen for plotfile (first character of name `)
   Added built-in command-line option help
   Added option to create separate output files for each section
   Added option to set the maximum number of pages for each section
   Added MAKETEXPK environment variable for alternative command
   Added support for MSDOS binary .pfb files
   -M now creates a file `missfont.log' for all fonts that were needed
      but not created; this file can be executed to generate the fonts.
   VM/CMS support added.
   The p configuration file option can now be used as `p+', meaning
      `read in an additional psfonts map file', rather than just
      overriding the default one.  You can read in as many such files
      as you desire.
   Added -k to print crop marks; also increases desired page size.
      Should use special{papersize=} or -T with this.
   Added -T option to specify desired page size in whatever units,
      to complement -t to specify desired page size by name.  Can
      use -t to specify paper format that sets size automatically
      (such as film0 or film1) *and* -T to set desired size.
   The -E option will create an EPSF file with a tight bounding
      box.  Fails if you have a multi-page file, or if you
      include any PS graphics.  Intended for creating simple
      tables and equations or whatnot as EPSF.
   Resident PostScript fonts now use almost no memory!
   Added ability to re-encode PostScript fonts with PostScript
      vectors and/or vf fonts.
   The afm2tfm now prints out the psfonts.map entry you need to add.
   Now uses (or approximates) header file VM for more accurate budgeting.
   The -b option will allow color separation or poster or other fancy
      printing options that require the page `text' be repeated a constant
      number of times.  (See config.post3x3).

Bug fixes:

   Minor changes to MakeTeXPK to get around poor gftopk ports
   Fixed some bugs in tpic support
   Fixed bug in EPSF inclusion when file name as _ and _ is active
   Unfixed that bug since it caused other bugs.
   Fixed EPSF incompatibility with macro packages that redefine \empty
   Fixed subtle psfig scaling problem
   Improved spacing for characters with negative widths
   Worked around problem with Blue Sky CM/PostScript fonts
   Worked around a full md directory with Mac System 7.
   Fixed bug in using PostScript fonts and different h/v resolutions.
   Uses cmr10.tfm if a TFM file can't be found.
   Made @beginspecia/@endspecial clean up the stack more like
      Adobe says it should.
   Made color work even when pages selected, reversed, -C used, -a
      used, etc.  (Pretty much rewritten from scratch.)
   Made PostScript fonts come out the correct size.  (Previously
      the fonts were too small by 3/800 or less than .4%.)
   Made psfig work, even with files that define /a to be something else.
   Fixed header file bug; no idea how it crept in.

Unfortunates:

   Removed all occurences of /name /operator load def, even though this
      costs a slight speed penalty, because I'm sick of working around
      everyone else's bind problems.

Aesthetic or pedagogical changes:

   Landscape rotated 180 degrees to fit PostScript conventions
   Shortened makefile
   Added accent fixes to psfonts.sty
   Man page removed (anyone want to write a short man page, that refers to the
      dvips.tex manual, which will be in the TeX input path from now on?)
   Limited number of errors due to specials
   Made % expansion in path apply on a per-path-element basis rather than
      overall
   Removed t option in configuration file (use @ instead)
   Removed default paths (why default paths?  User should set on compilation)
   Removed possibility to use long name as PostScript font name.

afm2tfm:

   Turned off ligatures in fixed-pitch fonts
   Made bad kern pairs in AFM files a warning, rather than a fatal error
   Removed accent ligatures from PostScript fonts for compatibility with plain
   Added automatic derivation of a PostScript space character
