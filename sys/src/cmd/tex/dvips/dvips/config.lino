*   This configuration file is a sample one for a typesetter.  See the
*   end of the file especially, where we use setpageparams.  With a
*   configuration file like this, you can use
*
*   -t film0 -k -T 11in,17in
*
*   for instance to print an 11x17 inch document in orientation 0 with
*   crop marks.

*   These last two are only for typesetters that can set the page size;
*   uncomment and put them in a `config.lino', for instance.

*   Use this for pages where you want the text to run in the same direction
*   as the film feeds (slow scan direction; down the length of the film.)
*   Best for everything *but* pages higher than the film is wide or pages
*   wider than they are tall; needed for pages wider than the film is wide.

*   the film (fast scan direction.)  Needed for pages taller than the film
