All real documentation is now in the file dvips.tex.  There is also a file
called test.tex that you can read and run to test some basic capabilities of
dvips.  INSTALLATION has the primary installation instructions.

I will be convering dvips over to using fontinst fonts---soon.  I will also
be adding some new `standard' specials and context specials.  So things
will probably be changing a fair bit soon.  (Of course, I plan to maintain
full backward compatibility.)

If you enjoy using dvips, you will probably enjoy being a member of 
the TeX Users Group.  To join or contribute to TUG, contact them at
