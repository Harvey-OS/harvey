This file records noteworthy changes.
3.2 (15 March 1998)
* Brace expansion will accept the path separator as well as the comma,
  e.g., {foo:bar}.
* For TeX, we only recognize one suffix, because there is no such thing
  as a canonical list of TeX suffixes.
* We distinguish between two kinds of suffixes in the code: the standard
  suffixes which may be appended to filenames when searching; and the
  alternative suffixes which are never appended, but when found this
  prevents a search with one of the standard suffixes. 
* kpse_reset_program_name: change assumed program name, resets the search
  paths, so that searches will work as expected for the new name.
* kpse_set_program_name: new function, replaces kpse_set_progname.
* The MakeTeX* scripts have been renamed to mktex* forms.

3.1 (10 November 1997)
* The support for multiple texmf trees is much improved.
* New MakeTeX* scripts, based on teTeX's.  These scripts now use
  heuristics to decide where generated files are placed and which
  permissions they should have.
* The varfonts feature is enabled by default.
* Some MSDOS/Win32 support added to the sources.
* Change in searching algorithm: if a name doesn't have the default suffix
  we append it for the first search.  Then we search for the bare name.
  Thus if you have foo.bar and foo.bar.tex, the latter will now be found
  first.  Under the old system, you had to specify boo.bar.tex.tex to get
  foo.bar.tex instead of foo.bar.
* Prepend the value of KPSE_DOT to relative paths from texmf.cnf if it
  defined in the environment.  This means we can use . instead of
  $KPSE_DOT in paths.
* Define brace expansion so that {a,b}{1,2} expands to a1:b1:a2:b2.  This
  is different from how shells do it, and exploited in texmf.in.
* Renamed texmf.cnf.in to texmf.in.
* New value for debugging: DEBUG_VARS, equal to 64.
* If a file format has no suffix, allow its long name as the argument to
  kpsewhich --format.

3.0 (7 February 1997)
* Distribution terms changed to the GNU Library General Public License.
* Default directory structure matches the TDS standard. The most
  important change is in the fonts/ directory: the file type (tfm, pk)
  is now directly underneath fonts/.  Also, mft/ is now at the top level.
  `modeless' is used for gsftopk/ps2pk/etc.-generated fonts.
* Change in searching algorithm: if the name already has a suffix
  (foo.sty), search for it by itself first, before appending the default
  suffix (foo.sty.tex).  This loses if you have an executable named
  foo.bar, with documentation in foo.bar.tex (foo.bar will be found
  first).  But this is unusual, and the other case is common.
* Environment variables PATH_program (e.g., TEXINPUTS_latex) checked
  for, as with configuration file values (TEXINPUTS.latex).
* Multiple TEXMF trees supported, via the following new facility:
* Shell brace expansion {foo,bar} implemented, thanks to Bash.
* Multiple ls-R files supported via the TEXMFDBS path.
* An ``alias'' database for files in ls-R supported, to handle 8.3 problems.
* Directories in the ls-R file can be relative (./) as well as absolute (/).
* New MakeTeX{PK,TFM,MF} scripts with more features, based on teTeX's.
* DVIPSMAKEPK (etc.) actually overrides the name `MakeTeXPK', as documented.
* MakeTeX* can be globally disabled via configure options.
* Support for building as a shared library with configure --enable-shared.
* Directories whose names begin with `.' are ignored.
* Some warnings can be suppressed by TEX_HUSH cnf value or envvar.
* kpsewhich has many new capabilities, documented via --help and in the manual.
* texfonts.map parsing has an include directive, and @c is a comment.
* Input lines in texmf.cnf can be continued with \.
* TEXMFLOG can be set in texmf.cnf, as previously documented.
* SELFAUTODIR and SELFAUTOPARENT are defined according to the location
  of the binary, and used to search for texmf.cnf.
* /// (or more) is equivalent to //.
* If $HOME = / (as with root on some systems), avoid creating // in paths.
* Support for AFM, PostScript Type 1 font, source, documentation, Omega,
  and MetaPost-related file formats.
* New header kpathsea.h with all #include files.
* Under DOS, ls-R lines need not start with . or / or \ (e.g., c:).
* Amiga support.

2.6 (9 January 1995)
* MakeTeXPK installed from kpathsea, instead of each driver.
* MakeTeXPK.site looked for in texmf/web2c, instead of texmf/dvips.
* texmf.cnf installed and looked for in texmf/web2c, instead of texmf.
* If a mode is not explicitly specified, search all subdirectories (this
  was actually in a previous release).
* install-sh only looked for in the top-level directory.
* kpsewhich replaces and generalizes kpsexpand.

2.5 (15 December 1994)
* Go back to calling db_insert after a successful MakeTeXPK, and check
  for lack of an ls-R.
* Handle case of magstep -.5 for MakeTeXPK properly.

2.4 (28 October 1994)
* Avoid calling db_insert, which caused a segmentation fault.

2.3 (26 October 1994)
* Extra :'s in an envvar value, referring to the texmf.cnf value, work.
* Names like dpi600/cmr10.pk can be found in ls-R.
* KPATHSEA_DEBUG environment variable checked.
* Directories like pk/ljfour directly under $TEXMF/fonts are found.
* New standalone program, kpsexpand, optionally compiled and installed,
  to do variable expansion (not path searching).
* Debugging output written to stderr instead of stdout.
* pxlNNN support removed; I never intended to support `pxl1500', and
  pxl300 is never used.

2.2 (14 October 1994)
* MakeTeXPK invoked for the any_glyph type; this is for xdvik.
* MakeTeXPK sources $(psheaderdir)/MakeTeXPK.site if it exists.
* pxlNNN/cmr10.pk searched for (as well as dpiNNN/cmr10.pk and cmr10.NNNpk)

2.1 (12 September 1994)
* Manual goes through TeX, and .cps/.aux files are in the distribution.
* INSTALL* variables set at the top level.
* Dependency on GNU tr making paths.h and texmf.sed (->texmf.cnf) removed.
* texmf.cnf installed if it didn't previously exist.

2.0 (8 September 1994)
* Runtime configuration file support; see the manual.
* Both dpi600/cmr10.pk and cmr10.600pk are searched for.
* ls-R matches $TEXMF//latex2e vs. $TEXMF//latex209.
* $TEXMFLOG, if set, specifies a filename for logging successful searches.
* All directory entries beginning with `.' are ignored, not just `.' and `..'.
* Default path for PK and GF fonts includes the mode name.
* ls-R is in $TEXMFROOT instead of hardwired at compile time.
* More debugging flags, and they can be set with client program options.
* If MakeTeX{PK,TFM} fail, or aren't invoked, a file missfont.log is
  written with the requisite commands, as in dvips.
* More 328/329/330 fixes, maybe for the last time.
* The override font paths (XDVIFONTS etc.) apply only to glyph (PK/GF)
  searches, not TFM or VF.
* -g is not the default when linking, to avoid unnecessarily large binaries
  (due to static libraries) under Linux.
* configure checks for a smart putenv.
* Stat results are cached to speed up disk searches.

1.8 (2 April 1994)
* New target install-info, so the documentation can be installed without
  the headers.
* Existing but unreadable files are complained about, instead of just ignored.
* A leading %% in a path element forbids searching the disk for that
  element; only a db will be searched (if it exists).
* The db is only used if it might be relevant to a given path element,
  not searched first regardless.

1.7 (1 March 1994)
* Searches can use an externally-built ls-R ``database'', for speed.
* `VPATH = .' lines removed from generated Makefile, for broken Sun make.
* A path foo//tfm finds foo/tfm as well as foo/*/tfm.

1.6 (3 February 1994)
* Memory fault in copying long paths fixed.
* More variables passed down from the top-level Makefile.
* Mention SMART_PUTENV in the INSTALL file, and fix bug in xputenv.c
  when one envvar is a proper prefix of another.
* More attempts at eliminating magstephalf annoyances.
* Directory name substitutions are done globally when creating paths.h.
* Various changes for DOS.

1.5 (24 January 1994)
* Default paths changed.
* Defining GCC_WCHAR lets GCC define wchar_t.
* EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS defined in all cases (if they're not already).
* str[r]chr never redefined (I hope).

1.4 (3 November 1993)
* Check closest fallback font size.
* All default paths (including dvips') in paths.h.in, not the Makefile.
* Rearrange directory lists so that dirs in which a file is found
  migrate to the top.
* Update for Autoconf 1.7.

1.3 (6 October 1993)
* Fix free of non-malloced memory bug.
* Fix uninitialized gf path bug.
* mkdirchain invoked as an absolute filename.

1.2 (27 September 1993)
* Running MakeTeXPK is tried before the fallback resolutions.
* The final bitmap name uses a variable spec, so DOS & OS/2 can get
  dpi300/cmr10.pk.
* Document TeX-specific features.
* Dpi passed to MakeTeXPK via the envvar KPATHSEA_DPI instead of MAKETEX_DPI.

1.1 (26 August 1993)
* Installation fixes.

1.0 (5 August 1993)
* Routines to look up TeX font files, default path specifications, etc.
* Sort-of pattern matching: /foo//bar matches subdirectories
  /foo/a/bar, /foo/b/bar, /foo/a1/a2/bar, etc.
* $var and ${var} expansion.
* Support for MakeTeX... scripts.
* Support for fallback resolutions and font.
* Lazy evaluation of path elements.
* Some runtime debugging support.
