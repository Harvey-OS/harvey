Subject: ss-921123: using isascii with <ctype.h> macros

  Yesterday some cursory regression testing found that GNU od
  (in an upcoming release of textutils) generated incorrect output
  when run on an SGI indigo because isprint ('\377') returned true.
  Of course, '\377' is not a printing character;  the problem lay
  in using isprint without first making sure its integer argument
  corresponded to an ascii code.

  MORAL: always guard uses of ctype macros with isascii if it's available.
  An obvious alternative is to avoid <ctype.h> and define and use your
  own versions of the ctype macros.

  A pretty clean approach to using <ctype.h> and isascii was
  suggested by David MacKenzie:

  #ifndef isascii
  #define isascii(c) 1
  #endif

  #define ISDIGIT(c) (isascii (c) && isdigit (c))
  #define ISPRINT(c) (isascii (c) && isprint (c))
  ...

  then, use ISDIGIT, etc. instead of isdigit, etc.  */
