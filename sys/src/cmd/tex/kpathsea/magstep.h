/* If DPI is close enough to some magstep of BDPI, return the true dpi
   value, and the magstep found (or zero) in M_RET (if
   non-null). ``Close enough'' means within one pixel.
   
   M_RET is slightly encoded: the least significant bit is on for a
   half-magstep, off otherwise.  Thus, a returned M_RET of 1 means
   \magstephalf, i.e., sqrt(1.2), i.e., 1.09544.  Put another way,
   return twice the number of magsteps.
   
   In practice, this matters for magstephalf.  Floating-point computation
   with the fixed-point DVI representation leads to 328 (for BDPI ==
   300); specifying `at 11pt' yields 330; the true \magstephalf is 329
   (that's what you get if you run Metafont with mag:=magstep(.5)).
   
   The time to call this is after you read the font spec from the DVI
   file, but before you look up any files -- do the usual floating-point
   computations, and then fix up the result.  */
