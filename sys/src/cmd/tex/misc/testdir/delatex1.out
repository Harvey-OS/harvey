This
is
sample
input
file
Comparing
it
with
the
output
it
generates
can
show
you
how
to
produce
simple
document
of
your
own
Ordinary
Text
The
ends
of
words
and
sentences
are
marked
by
spaces
It
doesn't
matter
how
many
spaces
you
type
one
is
as
good
as
The
end
of
line
counts
as
space
One
or
more
blank
lines
denote
the
end
of
paragraph
Since
any
number
of
consecutive
spaces
are
treated
like
single
one
the
formatting
of
the
input
file
makes
no
difference
to
but
it
makes
difference
to
you
When
you
use
making
your
input
file
as
easy
to
read
as
possible
will
be
great
help
as
you
write
your
document
and
when
you
change
it
This
sample
file
shows
how
you
can
add
comments
to
your
own
input
file
Because
printing
is
different
from
typewriting
there
are
number
of
things
that
you
have
to
do
differently
when
preparing
an
input
file
than
if
you
were
just
typing
the
document
directly
Quotation
marks
like
this
have
to
be
handled
specially
as
do
quotes
within
quotes
this
is
what
just
wrote
not
that
Dashes
come
in
three
sizes
an
intra
word
dash
medium
dash
for
number
ranges
like
and
punctuation
dash
like
this
sentence
ending
space
should
be
larger
than
the
space
between
words
within
sentence
You
sometimes
have
to
type
special
commands
in
conjunction
with
punctuation
characters
to
get
this
right
as
in
the
following
sentence
Gnats
gnus
etc
all
begin
with
You
should
check
the
spaces
after
periods
when
reading
your
output
to
make
sure
you
haven't
forgotten
any
special
cases
Generating
an
ellipsis
with
the
right
spacing
around
the
periods
requires
special
command
interprets
some
common
characters
as
commands
so
you
must
type
special
commands
to
generate
them
These
characters
include
the
following
and
In
printing
text
is
emphasized
by
using
an
italic
type
style
long
segment
of
text
can
also
be
emphasized
in
this
way
Text
within
such
segment
given
additional
emphasis
with
Roman
type
Italic
type
loses
its
ability
to
emphasize
and
become
simply
distracting
when
used
excessively
It
is
sometimes
necessary
to
prevent
from
breaking
line
where
it
might
otherwise
do
so
This
may
be
at
space
as
between
the
Mr
and
Jones
in
Mr
Jones
or
within
word
especially
when
the
word
is
symbol
like
itemnum
that
makes
little
sense
when
hyphenated
across
lines
Footnotes
This
is
an
example
of
footnote
pose
no
problem
is
good
at
typesetting
mathematical
formulas
like
or
Remember
that
letter
like
is
formula
when
it
denotes
mathematical
symbol
and
should
be
treated
as
one
Displayed
Text
Text
is
displayed
by
indenting
it
from
the
left
margin
Quotations
are
commonly
displayed
There
are
short
quotations
This
is
short
quotation
It
consists
of
single
paragraph
of
text
There
is
no
paragraph
indentation
and
longer
ones
This
is
longer
quotation
It
consists
of
two
paragraphs
of
text
The
beginning
of
each
paragraph
is
indicated
by
an
extra
indentation
This
is
the
second
paragraph
of
the
quotation
It
is
just
as
dull
as
the
first
paragraph
Another
frequently
displayed
structure
is
list
The
following
is
an
example
of
an
itemized
list
This
is
the
first
item
of
an
itemized
list
Each
item
in
the
list
is
marked
with
tick
The
document
style
determines
what
kind
of
tick
mark
is
used
This
is
the
second
item
of
the
list
It
contains
another
list
nested
inside
it
The
inner
list
is
an
enumerated
list
This
is
the
first
item
of
an
enumerated
list
that
is
nested
within
the
itemized
list
This
is
the
second
item
of
the
inner
list
allows
you
to
nest
lists
deeper
than
you
really
should
This
is
the
rest
of
the
second
item
of
the
outer
list
It
is
no
more
interesting
than
any
other
part
of
the
item
This
is
the
third
item
of
the
list
You
can
even
display
poetry
There
is
an
environment
for
verse
Whose
features
some
poets
will
curse
For
instead
of
making
Them
do
all
line
breaking
It
allows
them
to
put
too
many
words
on
line
when
they'd
rather
be
forced
to
be
terse
Mathematical
formulas
may
also
be
displayed
displayed

long
multiline
formulas
require
special
formatting
instructions
Don't
start
paragraph
with
displayed
equation
nor
make
one
paragraph
by
itself
