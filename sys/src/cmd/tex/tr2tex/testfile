This file demonstrates the use of \fB tr2tex\fR which translates
documents written in troff to a LaTeX style.
Examples are given to show what the translator can do.

First let's test some equation written for the
.B eqn
preprocessor:
.EQ (1)
2 left ( 1 ~+~ sqrt{omega sub i+1 + zeta -{x+1} over {THETA +1} y + 1} right )
~~~=~~~ 1

.EQ
left [
matrix {
   ccol { e sub 1 above . above . above e sub i above . above . above e sub N }
}
right ] sub n+1 ~~=~~ y + 1

In-line math like $beta +1$ which is surrounded by math delimiters, as
defined by
.I delim
is also translated.

Only simple tables are translated. Translation of more complicated tables
is painful and I won't do it now. Here is an example:
.TS
tab(&);
l rc n.
name	& type		& color	& value
$alpha$	& real		& red	& 2.3
$x$	& imaginary	& green	& -1.2
$a + 2$	& real		& white	& 0.0

Try some floating objects.
.br

This text should be kept in one page. i.e. a page break is discouraged here.
.KE
.br
Now a floating text.
.KF
This text should be kept in one page even if we had to move it around,
since it is a
.I floating
object. This is a boxed
.BX word.
.KE
.br
These characters are special in TeX, so they need to be escaped
in the translation % & # _, while these characters have to be
printed in math mode < > |.

Thanks to all of those who contributed by reporting bugs and suggesting
some improvements. Special thanks go to Nelson Beebe for all of his valuable
contributions and suggestions. He is responsible for making the translator
portable to other computers. He also made significant improvements to
the translation of manuals.
