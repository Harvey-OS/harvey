			INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In short, type ``make'' and then run it on the document (try the testfile):
		tr2tex testfile > testfile.tex

In details:

- Use makefile.msc if you're running MS-DOS.
- In the makefile, define the destination of the executable (default is
  current directory). Also, add the -O flag if you want to (and the
  optimizer in your machine is not buggy). The -O flag causes long compilation
  time but experience has shown that it is unnecessary for this package;
  time saved in running time is extremely small in the computers I used.
- If the limit on your unsigned int is not 65535, change MAXLEN in
  setups.h accordingly.
- In tr2tex.c, change the document type if you want. The default is article.
  Also, change the style options to suit your taste. The default
  is [troffms,11pt] if no flag is used and [troffman] if the -m flag is used.
- Add necessary -D's to CFLAGS if you need them. The program recognizes the
  following compiler-time definitions:
	   -Dtops20, -DANSI, -DMSC, -DNO_SGTTY
- type ``make'' to produce the executable, called ``tr2tex''.
- Modify troffms.sty and troffman.sty to suit your taste but keep the
  necessary macro definitions as they will be needed when running latex.
  Make sure the font names exist on your site. Change them if necessary.
- Move troffms.sty and troffman.sty to your macros directory.
- Install and read the manual page.
- Run the translator on ``testfile'' and the manual page as follows
		tr2tex testfile > testfile.tex
		tr2tex -m tr2tex.9 > tr2tex.9.tex
  
  and compare ``testfile.tex'' with ``testfile.tex-orig'' and
  ``tr2tex.9.tex'' with ``tr2tex.9-tex-orig''.
  If they are not identical, you have not installed it properly.


			USING THE TRANSLATOR

You can run the program either by
		tr2tex < file  > file.tex
or
		tr2tex file  > file.tex
You are most likely to get messages on the standard error telling
you about things it encounters and cannot do.

Now you have the translated document. Look at it and see if you
can spot a major error. Run it through latex. If it runs and produces
the dvi file, then print it. If you get latex error messages modify
the translated document accordingly and repeat the latex run, and so on.
I usually get away with one or two iterations.
