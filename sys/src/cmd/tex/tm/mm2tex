# Translate from troff/mm to LaTex/tm.sty
# Created by Terry L Anderson 91 May 28
# Standard in: file in MM format.
# Standard out: file in LaTex format using tm.sty
# Intended for use by humans - it does various checks before executing.
# Arguments: parameter 1 == name of MM file with or without .mm extension.
# This program produces an Latex file with the .tex extension.

# First test if the file is okay to use.

if test -r "$1.mm"; then INF="$1.mm"; BASEFILE=$1
   else if test -r "$1"; then INF="$1" BASEFILE=`basename $1 .mm`
   else echo "No $1, $1.mm found";exit
fi fi 

# Actual translation follows.

mm2tex.sh <$INF >$BASEFILE.tex
