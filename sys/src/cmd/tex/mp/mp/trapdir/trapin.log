I'm afraid I don't know how to apply that operation to that
combination of types. Continue, and I'll return the second
argument (see above) as the result of the operation.

You should have said `let symbol = something'.
But don't worry; I'll pretend that an equals sign
was present. The next token I read will be `something'.

The next thing in this loop should have been a `:'.
So I'll pretend that a colon was present;
everything from here to `endfor' will be iterated.

Uh, oh. A little while ago one of the quantities that I was
computing got too large, so I'm afraid your answers will be
somewhat askew. You'll probably have to adopt different
tactics next time. But I shall try to carry on anyway.

I can't set an internal quantity to anything but a known
numeric value, so I'll have to ignore this assignment.

{p~:=32767.99998}

The equation I just processed has given some variable
a value of 4096 or more. Continue and I'll try to cope
with that big value; but it might be dangerous.
(Set warningcheck:=0 to suppress this message.)

I found no right delimiter to match a left one. So I've
put one in, behind the scenes; this may fix the problem.
