even though it follows a %-sign
A string "even with etex or btex in it" is ignored
TeX material such as btex$a+b$ etex is often very short.

Removing the initial %-sign on any of the following

% unmatched etex
% btex verbatimtex in tex mode etex
% btex tex text btex more text etex.
% a non-ending verbatimtex section
No visible "etex" here.
