Links 2.1pre14 -- How To Install
--------------------------------

Follow this step-by-step:
0) Check you have installed the following libraries and are able to compile with
   them. On a package-driven distribution, you will need both "library" and
   "library-dev(el)":

   libpng - required to compile links in graphics mode (not required in text
            mode).
   IJG libjpeg - if you want to display JPEG's (probably yes).
   TIFF Library - if you want TIFFs.
   SVGAlib - if you want Links to be able to display on SVGAlib.
   OpenSSL - if you want SSL connections.

   If any of the library is not present on the system or is unusably old and you cannot install it
   (typically because you are not a root), then go to 11) Compiling with
   user-supplied libraries.
1) Do not forget to run "ldconfig" if you have installed any new libraries :-)
2) "./configure --help"
   Read the output and choose which options you want to give ./configure.
   Probably you will want --enable-graphics and --enable-javascript and some
   more
3) "./configure <your options>"
4) Check the output of ./configure (in the table at the end) whether you really
   get what you want
5) "make"
6) If you are a root, "make install" with root privileges. If not, copy the 
   resulting "links" executable into some suitable place, preferrably within 
   your $PATH. The whole browser is just one executable.
7) If you haven't got a permanent Internet connection, save the "doc/"
   subdirectory into some suitable place (/usr/share/, /usr/local/share). The
   most important part is the "doc/links_cal/" subdirectory which contains a calibration pattern
   (calibration.html in English, kalibrace.html in Czech)
   you will need to get a flawless picture on your monitor.
8) If you want to supply a Links icon into your X Window System windowmanager,
   you will find a suitable 48x48 icon in graphics/links.xpm
9) Delete the archive and source directory - no more needed
10) The browser is ready now. You just have to calibrate it to get a flawless
   picture (see doc/calibration.html or the Links homepage, which is in default
   bookmarks).

11) Compiling with user-supplied libraries.
    This describes how to compile Links with user-supplied libraries zlib,
    libpng, libpjpeg and libtiff. If you want to use any of these libraries from
    the system, omit appropriate references. The versions are just for example:

    Download libpng-1.2.3, zlib-1.1.4, libjpeg-6b and libtiff-v3.5.7
    archives and unpack them. Build the libraries according to their
    instructions to get static (*.a) library in each.

    export CPPFLAGS="-I../zlib-1.1.4 -I../libpng-1.2.3 -I../jpeg-6b
	-I../tiff-v3.5.7/libtiff"
    export LDFLAGS="=L../zlib-1.1.4 -L../libpng-1.2.3 -L../jpeg-6b
        -L ../tiff-v3.5.7/libtiff"
    goto 2)

PITFALLS
--------

Compile:

Unix - use ./configure; make
	in some FreeBSD 3 distributions you have to set CFLAGS=-aout before
	running ./configure
	Tested on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, IRIX

OS/2 - use ./configure; make
	You must have GNU bash and GNU text/shell/file utilities so that
	configure can run
	The only supported compiler is EMX, you probably won't be able to
	compile it with anything else

	configure under OS/2 needs to know paths to gcc, make anb bash. Set (for
	example):
	SET HOSTTYPE=i586
	SET MACHTYPE=i586-pc-os2
	SET CONFIG_SHELL=d:/prg/gnu/bin/bash.exe
	SET CC=d:/prg/emx/bin/gcc.exe
	SET MAKE=d:/prg/emx/bin/make.exe
	SET EMXOPT=-h100

Dos, Windows - port it yourself

Install:

Unix - make install

OS/2 - copy file links.exe somewhere to your path or create CMD file that runs
	links

WARNING: EMX has nasty limit of open files. Links will work badly or won't work
	with default settings. Set variable EMXOPT=-h100 before you run links.
