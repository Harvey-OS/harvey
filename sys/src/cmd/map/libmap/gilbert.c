/* derivation of the interesting part:
   map the sphere onto the plane by stereographic projection;
   map the plane onto a half plane by sqrt;
   map the half plane back to the sphere by stereographic
   projection

   n,w are original lat and lon
   r is stereographic radius
   primes are transformed versions

   r = cos(n)/(1+sin(n))
   r' = sqrt(r) = cos(n')/(1+sin(n'))

   r'^2 = (1-sin(n')^2)/(1+sin(n')^2) = cos(n)/(1+sin(n))

   this is a linear equation for sin n', with solution

   sin n' = (1+sin(n)-cos(n))/(1+sin(n)+cos(n))

   use standard formula: tan x/2 = (1-cos x)/sin x = sin x/(1+cos x)
   to show that the right side of the last equation is tan(n/2)
