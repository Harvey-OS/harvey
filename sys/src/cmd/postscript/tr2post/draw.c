 * Spline drawing routine for Postscript printers. The complicated stuff is
 * handled by procedure Ds, which should be defined in the library file. I've
 * seen wrong implementations of troff's spline drawing, so fo the record I'll
 * write down the parametric equations and the necessary conversions to Bezier
 * cubic splines (as used in Postscript).
 *
 * Parametric equation (x coordinate only):
 *
 *	    (x2 - 2 * x1 + x0)    2                    (x0 + x1)
 *	x = ------------------ * t   + (x1 - x0) * t + ---------
 *		    2					   2
 *
 * The coefficients in the Bezier cubic are,
 *
 *	A = 0
 *	B = (x2 - 2 * x1 + x0) / 2
 *	C = x1 - x0
 *
 * while the current point is,
 *
 *	current-point = (x0 + x1) / 2
 *
 * Using the relationships given in the Postscript manual (page 121) it's easy to
 * see that the control points are given by,
 *
 *	x0' = (x0 + 5 * x1) / 6
 *	x1' = (x2 + 5 * x1) / 6
 *	x2' = (x1 + x2) / 2
 *
 * where the primed variables are the ones used by curveto. The calculations
 * shown above are done in procedure Ds using the coordinates set up in both
 * the x[] and y[] arrays.
 *
 * A simple test of whether your spline drawing is correct would be to use cip
 * to draw a spline and some tangent lines at appropriate points and then print
 * the file.

/*
 * Simple minded attempt at parsing the string that followed an "x X DrawPath"
 * command. Everything not recognized here is simply ignored - there's absolutely
 * no error checking and what was originally in buf is clobbered by strtok().
 * A typical *buf might look like,
 *
 *	gray .9 fill stroke
 *
 * to fill the current path with a gray level of .9 and follow that by stroking the
 * outline of the path. Since unrecognized tokens are ignored the last example
 * could also be written as,
 *
 *	with gray .9 fill then stroke
 *
 * The "with" and "then" strings aren't recognized tokens and are simply discarded.
 * The "stroke", "fill", and "wfill" force out appropriate PostScript code and are
 * followed by a grestore. In otherwords changes to the grahics state (eg. a gray
 * level or color) are reset to default values immediately after the stroke, fill,
 * or wfill tokens. For now "fill" gets invokes PostScript's eofill operator and
 * "wfill" calls fill (ie. the operator that uses the non-zero winding rule).
 *
 * The tokens that cause temporary changes to the graphics state are "gray" (for
 * setting the gray level), "color" (for selecting a known color from the colordict
 * dictionary defined in *colorfile), and "line" (for setting the line width). All
 * three tokens can be extended since strncmp() makes the comparison. For example
 * the strings "line" and "linewidth" accomplish the same thing. Colors are named
 * (eg. "red"), but must be appropriately defined in *colorfile. For now all three
 * tokens must be followed immediately by their single argument. The gray level
 * (ie. the argument that follows "gray") should be a number between 0 and 1, with
 * 0 for black and 1 for white.
 *
 * To pass straight PostScript through enclose the appropriate commands in double
 * quotes. Straight PostScript is only bracketed by the outermost gsave/grestore
 * pair (ie. the one from the initial "x X BeginPath") although that's probably
 * a mistake. Suspect I may have to change the double quote delimiters.
