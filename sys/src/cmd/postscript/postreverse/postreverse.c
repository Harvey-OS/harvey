/*
 * postreverse - reverse the page order in certain PostScript files.
 *
 * Page reversal relies on being able to locate sections of a document using file
 * structuring comments defined by Adobe (ie. the 1.0 and now 2.0 conventions) and
 * a few I've added. Among other things a minimally conforming document, according
 * to the 1.0 conventions,
 *
 *	1) Marks the end of the prologue with an %%EndProlog comment.
 *
 *	2) Starts each page with a %%Page: comment.
 *
 *	3) Marks the end of all the pages %%Trailer comment.
 *
 *	4) Obeys page independence (ie. pages can be arbitrarily rearranged).
 *
 * The most important change (at least for this program) that Adobe made in going
 * from the 1.0 to the 2.0 structuring conventions was in the prologue. They now
 * say the prologue should only define things, and the global initialization that
 * was in the prologue (1.0 conventions) should now come after the %%EndProlog
 * comment but before the first %%Page: comment and be bracketed by %%BeginSetup
 * and %%EndSetup comments. So a document that conforms to Adobe's 2.0 conventions,
 *
 *	1) Marks the end of the prologue (only definitions) with %%EndProlog.
 *
 *	2) Brackets global initialization with %%BeginSetup and %%EndSetup comments
 *	   which come after the prologue but before the first %Page: comment.
 *
 *	3) Starts each page with a %%Page: comment.
 *
 *	4) Marks the end of all the pages with a %%Trailer comment.
 *
 *	5) Obeys page independence.
 *
 * postreverse can handle documents that follow the 1.0 or 2.0 conventions, but has
 * also been extended slightly so it works properly with the translators (primarily
 * dpost) supplied with this package. The page independence requirement has been
 * relaxed some. In particular definitions exported to the global environment from
 * within a page should be bracketed by %%BeginGlobal and %%EndGlobal comments.
 * postreverse pulls them out of each page and inserts them in the setup section
 * of the document, immediately before it writes the %%EndProlog (for version 1.0)
 * or %%EndSetup (for version 2.0) comments.
 *
 * In addition postreverse accepts documents that choose to mark the end of each
 * page with a %%EndPage: comment, which from a translator's point of view is often
 * a more natural approach. Both page boundary comments (ie. Page: and %%EndPage:)
 * are also accepted, but be warned that everything between consecutive %%EndPage:
 * and %%Page: comments will be ignored.
 *
 * So a document that will reverse properly with postreverse,
 *
 *	1) Marks the end of the prologue with %%EndProlog.
 *
 *	2) May have a %%BeginSetup/%%EndSetup comment pair before the first %%Page:
 *	   comment that brackets any global initialization.
 *
 *	3) Marks the start of each page with a %%Page: comment, or the end of each
 *	   page with a %%EndPage: comment. Both page boundary comments are allowed.
 *
 *	4) Marks the end of all the pages with a %%Trailer comment.
 *
 *	5) Obeys page independence or violates it to a rather limited extent and
 *	   marks the violations with %%BeginGlobal and %%EndGlobal comments.
 *
 * If no file arguments are given postreverse copies stdin to a temporary file and
 * then processes that file. That means the input is read three times (rather than
 * two) whenever we handle stdin. That's expensive, and shouldn't be too difficult
 * to fix, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
