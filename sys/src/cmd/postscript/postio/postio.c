/*
 *
 * postio - RS-232 serial interface for PostScript printers
 *
 * A simple program that manages input and output for PostScript printers. Much
 * has been added and changed from early versions of the program, but the basic
 * philosophy is still the same. Don't send real data until we're certain we've
 * connected to a PostScript printer that's in the idle state and try to hold the
 * connection until the job is completely done. It's more work than you might
 * expect is necessary, but should provide a reasonably reliable spooler interface
 * that can return error indications to the caller via the program's exit status.
 *
 * I've added code that will let you split the program into separate read/write
 * processes. Although it's not the default it should be useful if you have a file
 * that will be returning useful data from the printer. The two process stuff was
 * laid down on top of the single process code and both methods still work. The
 * implementation isn't as good as it could be, but didn't require many changes
 * to the original program (despite the fact that there are now many differences).
 *
 * By default the program still runs as a single process. The -R2 option forces
 * separate read and write processes after the intial connection is made. If you
 * want that as the default initialize splitme (below) to TRUE. In addition the
 * -t option that's used to force stuff not recognized as status reports to stdout
 * also tries to run as two processes (by setting splitme to TRUE). It will only
 * work if the required code (ie. resetline() in ifdef.c) has been implemented
 * for your Unix system. I've only tested the System V code.
 *
 * Code needed to support interactive mode has also been added, although again it's
 * not as efficient as it could be. It depends on the system dependent procedures
 * resetline() and setupstdin() (file ifdef.c) and for now is only guaranteed to
 * work on System V. Can be requested using the -i option.
 *
 * Quiet mode (-q option) is also new, but was needed for some printers connected
 * to RADIAN. If you're running in quiet mode no status requests will be sent to
 * the printer while files are being transmitted (ie. in send()).
 *
 * The program expects to receive printer status lines that look like,
 *
 *	%%[ status: idle; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: waiting; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: initializing; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: busy; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: printing; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: PrinterError: out of paper; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: PrinterError: no paper tray; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *
 * although this list isn't complete. Sending a '\024' (control T) character forces
 * the return of a status report. PostScript errors detected on the printer result
 * in the immediate transmission of special error messages that look like,
 *
 *	%%[ Error: undefined; OffendingCommand: xxx ]%%
 *	%%[ Flushing: rest of job (to end-of-file) will be ignored ]%%
 *
 * although we only use the Error and Flushing keywords. Finally conditions, like
 * being out of paper, result in other messages being sent back from the printer
 * over the communications line. Typical PrinterError messages look like,
 *
 *	%%[ PrinterError: out of paper; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ PrinterError: paper jam; source: serial 25 ]%%
 *
 * although we only use the PrinterError keyword rather than trying to recognize
 * all possible printer errors.
 *
 * The implications of using one process and only flow controlling data going to
 * the printer are obvious. Job transmission should be reliable, but there can be
 * data loss in stuff sent back from the printer. Usually that only caused problems
 * with jobs designed to run on the printer and return useful data back over the
 * communications line. If that's the kind of job you're sending call postio with
 * the -t option. That should force the program to split into separate read and
 * write processes and everything not bracketed by "%%[ " and " ]%%" strings goes
 * to stdout. In otherwords the data you're expecting should be separated from the
 * status stuff that goes to the log file (or stderr). The -R2 option does almost
 * the same thing (ie. separate read and write processes), but everything that
 * comes back from the printer goes to the log file (stderr by default) and you'll
 * have to separate your data from any printer messages.
 *
 * A typical command line might be,
 *
 *	postio -l /dev/tty01 -b 9600 -L log file1 file2
 *
 * where -l selects the line, -b sets the baud rate, and -L selects the printer
 * log file. Since there's no default line, at least not right now, you'll always
 * need to use the -l option, and if you don't choose a log file stderr will be
 * used. If you have a program that will be returning data the command line might
 * look like,
 *
 *	postio -t -l/dev/tty01 -b9600 -Llog file >results
 *
 * Status stuff goes to file log while the data you're expecting back from the
 * printer gets put in file results.

 * generated on a printer and returned over the communications line using the
 * PostScript print operator. I'll assume PostScript jobs are well behaved and
 * never bracket their messages with "%%[ " and " ]%%" strings that delimit status
 * or error messages.
 *
 * Printer reports consist of one or more key/val pairs, and what we're interested
 * in (status or error indications) may not be the first pair in the list. In
 * addition we'll sometimes want the value associated with a keyword (eg. when
 * key = status) and other times we'll want the keyword (eg. when key = Error or
 * Flushing). The last pair isn't terminated by a semicolon and a value string
