JIS INDEX

These two files hold the JIS X 0208-1990 codes indexed by classical radical
and stroke count, level 1 (2,965 kanji) and level 2 (3,390 kanji).  Level one
holds the more common characters. They JIS codes are mapped to kuten codes
(区点コ−ド番号).  To convert:

kuten =  jis  / 256 * 100 +  jis  % 256 - 3232
 jis  = kuten / 100 * 256 + kuten % 100 + 8224

I believe that kuten was devoloped so office ladies could enter by number
rare kanji looked up in a kuten dictionary.  Kuten codes are always written
as a four digit number from 0101 for <SP> through 8406.

The format of each file in bnf is

( 0 <cr> ( [kuten] <cr> [stroke count] <cr> )* )^214

In other words, 214 repetitions of 0 on a line, followed by any number of
pairs of kuten and stroke count on their own lines.  Characters in the first
group are classically listed under radical #1 (一), etc.

Let me know if you are finishing up an application using these files.
