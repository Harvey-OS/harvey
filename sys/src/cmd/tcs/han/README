	this directory contains stuff to support the mapping
of han characters from one encoding into another. right now,
we are only considering the problem of japanese: kana and kanji.
the mapping is based on kuten codes; if you need to do characters that don't
have them, you are stuck.

	the basic mapping sources are desc.han (unicode vol 1 tables)
and han.raw (encoded form of the unicode volume 2 tables). the overall
product is kuten.c; the mkfile tells you how. the intermediate goal
is to generate a jis.font which is a mapping from kuten codes into unicodes.
it is incomplete, which is why supplementary mappings in jis.weird are added.
the han.bug mappings come from han.raw which is what the word processing
pool typed in from a pre-release copy of volume 2 of unicode.

	we have since discovered that unicode completely changed the
mappings in volume 2 before publication, so the unicode values of
all the kanji are incorrect.  we don't have the mapping we need to
fix this.  we hope to have it soon.  the only change to the system
would be to the fonts themselves.  we may eventually make an
electronic distribution of the new fonts.

	han.bwk contains minor adjustments to the mapping.
its format is obvious.

	the files *.bits contain the 16x16 and 24x24 bitmap fonts
for JIS 208. they also contain the kuten codes for jis 208.

usage:
	it is always safe to say

		mk -s all clean

	the only product is ../kuten.c and it only updates it if it
were to change.
