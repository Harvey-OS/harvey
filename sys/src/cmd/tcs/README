character set mappings:

	tcs embodies what we know about the mapping of character sets
into 10646/unicode and vice versa. there are three parts:
latin? alphabets described in desc.latin (from volume 1 of unicode)
and encoded in tables in tcs.c, cyrillic described in the subdirectory cyr
and encoded as tables in tcs.c, and han (chinese-japanese-korean ideographs)
described in the subdirectory han and encoded in kuten.c, big5.c, gb.c.

	if you want to tweak the han mappings, han/README tells how.

	to make the han bitmap fonts, go to the subdirectory font and say
mk fonts
