This directory contains a single useful file named sam.unix.
It is a shar file containing an X-windows version of sam
suitable for use on Unix systems.  Simply copy the file
to a Unix system and run it through a Bourne shell to unpack
it.  The README file in the root directory contains the
collected wisdom of many installations.

When you have sam running on your Unix system, it is possible
to run the front end on a Plan 9 terminal and the back end
on the Unix system, but not vice-versa; the Plan 9 authentication
scheme does not honor remote execution requests from a non-Plan 9
system.
