This program serves Unix files to Plan 9 machines.  It is to be run on a
Unix machine with its standard input, output, and error connected to a
network connection.  It runs as root and multiplexes access to multiple
clients over the single wire by simulating Unix permissions itself.
We run this service as '9fs' with tcp service number 564 over our
ethernets.  You may find that, due to a bug in some versions of the
IP software, your system will not accept the name '9fs', thinking it
is a service number because its first character is a digit.  If so,
complain to Berkeley (it's their bug) and run the service as u9fs or 564.

Set LOG to a proper place for a log file, and set up the makefile or mkfile
to use an ANSI C compiler.

If you want access to devices, attach to "device".  Otherwise, because
the program is single-threaded and may block unpredictably talking to
a device, it forbids such access. Device access may produce unpredictable
results if the block size of the device is greater than 8192, the Plan 9
RPC block size.

Inetd's configuration files must have the right entries in order for
it to offer 9fs service.  On our SGI machines, we add a line like this
to /etc/inetd.conf:

9fs           stream tcp   nowait root   /v/bin/u9fs u9fs

(if you put u9fs someplace other than /v/bin, change the line
to reflect that) and one like this to /etc/services:

9fs		564/tcp		9fs		# plan 9 fs

After changing /etc/inetd.conf we run
	/etc/killall -HUP inetd

Other BSD or System V machines should behave similarly, but caveat administrator.
