This directory contains the source for programs that
live in both the Plan 9 and Unix worlds.  The following
programs are supplied:

	u9fs - a Unix resident file server that serves the
		Plan 9 protocol, P9.

	sam - an X-windows version of the sam editor that runs
		on most popular Unix systems and Suns, too.

A README file in each subdirectory further explains each
program.
