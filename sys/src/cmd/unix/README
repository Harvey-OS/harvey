This directory contains source for some programs that
help Plan 9 co-exist with the non-Plan 9 world.

	9pfreebsd/
		Patches to FreeBSD 3.2 to add the IL network protocol
		and the pre-9P2000 version of 9P.

	drawterm/
		Drawterm is a Unix and Windows program that simulates
		a Plan 9 terminal to connect to a Plan 9 cpu server.
		The version in this directory speaks the pre-9P2000 
		protocols.  

		A new 9P2000 version is in progress but still crashes
		with some regularity on Unix.  It can be found at
		  http://cvs.pdos.csail.mit.edu/cvs/drawterm/
		or use
		  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.pdos.csail.mit.edu:/cvs co drawterm
		For more information about CVS, see
		  http://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man1/cvs.html

	u9fs/
		U9fs is a simple 9P server that runs on Unix.
		It serves both 9P2000 and the older 9P.

	netkey.c
		A standalone Unix version of Plan 9's netkey(1).

	winstart
	winplumb.c
	winplumb.exe
		Winstart is a shell script to be used with the plumber
		to relay plumbing messages (typically URLs) to a Windows
		machine.  It is particularly useful with VMware.
