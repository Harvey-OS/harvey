#
# setup the mail directories.  this should be done by the administrator since
# he/she will own everything.  the following files must be altered to reflect
# local preference.
#
# /mail/lib/namefiles	- remove alias files you don't use, insert ones you do.
# /mail/lib/remotemail	- change '-g research.research.bell-labs.com' to your own mail
#			  gateway.  if you have none, remove it.
#			- change '-h plan9.bell-labs.com' to a name you would like
#			  this host to be known as.  if you don't care, take it
#			  out and it will use the name in /env/site.
# /mail/lib/rewrite	- change the line that contains 'helix' to include names,
#			  other than the contents of /env/site, that your system
#			  answers to.  this is a hack and will be fixed.
