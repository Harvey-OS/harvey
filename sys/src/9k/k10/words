amd64 k10 & later; compatible intel64 systems
verified to work on
	asus p10s ws motherboards,
	super-micro x11scl-f motherboards,
	pc engines apu2c4 and apu2e4 systems, and
	intel nuc5i7s.
deliberately omitting support for obsolete or really annoying hardware.

64-bit capable; 48 address bits usable currently.
	no use of 5-level page tables.
can use arbitrary amounts of RAM, BIOS permitting: needs 2GB contiguous at 0.
	needs 1GB of kernel RAM to describe 32GB of user RAM.
	4, 16, 32 and 64 GB have all been used.
cpu and file server
	has been exercised as both
beginnings of a terminal; still needs vga & real mode support
serial console (optional)
serial ports on PCI(E) card
igbe & xgbe intel ethers
sata & nvme disks; ata & aoe can be easily made to work if needed
ehci usb might work on some hardware, if configured in;
	xhci presence seems to interfere
rebooting by direct loading of 386 9 and amd64 9k kernels now works,
	notably lzipped ones.
intel has a lot to answer for.

magic memory sizes by page table level
4K	small page, pte level
2M	large page, pd level
1G	pdp level
512G	pml4 level
256T	pml4 total

kernel vm map, from top of memory down:
-2M	PMAPADDR unknown size & use
-8M	PDMAP, unknown size, should be <= 6M
-512M	VMAP, 256M
-2G	KSEG0, 1.5G, kernel low memory to -512M above (VMAP),
	includes PDMAP in last kernel GB, may include Page structs.
-1T	KSEG1, 512G, only embedded PML4 & page tables
-128T	KSEG2, all non-KSEG0 physical memory above.
	Page structs often go here.
-256T	PML4 base, holds entire addr space
