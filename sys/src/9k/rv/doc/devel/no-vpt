there's a trick, called `virtual page table', used on 386 and amd64 systems
to insert the address of the root page table into the root page table, thus
allowing a virtual view of the page table tree as a contiguous array with
holes for missing pagge tables.  this is possible because one can't tell
(ignoring the Page Size bit) from looking at a 386/amd64 PTE what level of
the tree it corresponds to.  on risc-v each PTE identifies itself as leaf
or interior node, so the trick doesn't seem to be possible.

the KSEG1PTROOT trickery seems to be intended to map each machine's root
page table at the same address, so you always see your own, and to present
the page tables as a sparse contiguous array.

Here's an explanation of the trick on the 386:
---
But the processor has no concept of page directories, page tables, and
pages being anything other than plain memory.  So there's nothing that says
a particular page in memory can't serve as two or three of these at once.
The processor just follows pointers: pd = lcr3(); pt = *(pd+4*PDX); page =
*(pt+4*PTX);

Diagramatically, it starts at CR3, follows three arrows, and then stops.

If we put a pointer into the page directory that points back to itself at
index Z, then when we try to translate a virtual address with PDX and PTX
equal to V, following three arrows leaves us at the page directory.  So
that virtual page translates to the page holding the page directory.  In
Jos, V is 0x3BD, so the virtual address of the VPD is 0x3BD<<22|0x3BD<<12.

Now, if we try to translate a virtual address with PDX = V but an arbitrary
PTX != V, then following three arrows from CR3 ends one level up from usual
(instead of two as in the last case), which is to say in the page tables.
So the set of virtual pages with PDX=V form a 4MB region whose page
contents, as far as the processor is concerned, are the page tables
themselves.  In Jos, V is 0x3BD so the virtual address of the VPT is
0x3BD<<22.

So because of the "no-op" arrow we've cleverly inserted into the page
directory, we've mapped the pages being used as the page directory and page
table (which are normally virtually invisible) into the virtual address
space.
