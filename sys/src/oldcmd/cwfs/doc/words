'emelie' is for any Plan 9 machine with supported hardware (excluding
the SONY jukebox), and will make an object '9emeliefs' and use a 16KB
block size and 32-bit file sizes.  choline is similar, but with
conf.nfile cranked up.

fs uses a 4KB block size and 32-bit file sizes, rereads all blocks
written to the WORM, and is configured with more `large message'
buffers than is usual (for gigabit Ethernet).  fs64 is similar but
uses an 8KB block size and 64-bit file sizes, offsets and block
numbers, and consequently can only serve 9P2000, not 9P1.

9netics32.16k is like fs, but uses a 16KB block size and does not
reread blocks written to the WORM.  9netics64.8k is like fs64, but
uses an 8KB block size and does not reread blocks written to the WORM.

To spin-off a new version to play with, say 'test':

	cd /sys/src/cmd/cwfs
	mkdir test
	for (f in mkfile dat.h conf.c)
		sed '1s/emelie/test/' emelie/$f >test/$f

and hack as appropriate.  The primary choices are block size and 32-
or 64-bit sizes (in dat.h), and various configuration tweaks and
choice of 9P variants to serve (in conf.c).
