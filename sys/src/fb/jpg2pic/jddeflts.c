/* Default do-nothing progress monitoring routine.
 * This can be overridden by a user interface that wishes to
 * provide progress monitoring; just set methods->progress_monitor
 * after j_d_defaults is done.  The routine will be called periodically
 * during the decompression process.
 *
 * During any one pass, loopcounter increases from 0 up to (not including)
 * looplimit; the step size is not necessarily 1.  Both the step size and
 * the limit may differ between passes.  The expected total number of passes
 * is in cinfo->total_passes, and the number of passes already completed is
 * in cinfo->completed_passes.  Thus the fraction of work completed may be
 * estimated as
 *		completed_passes + (loopcounter/looplimit)
 *		------------------------------------------
 *				total_passes
 * ignoring the fact that the passes may not be equal amounts of work.
 *
 * When decompressing, the total_passes figure is an estimate that may be
 * on the high side; completed_passes will jump by more than one if some
 * passes are skipped.

 * Reload the input buffer after it's been emptied, and return the next byte.
 * See the JGETC macro for calling conditions.  Note in particular that
 * read_jpeg_data may NOT return EOF.  If no more data is available, it must
 * exit via ERREXIT, or perhaps synthesize fake data (such as an RST marker).
 * In the present implementation, we insert an EOI marker; this might not be
 * appropriate for non-JFIF file formats, but it usually allows us to handle
 * a truncated JFIF file.
 *
 * This routine can be overridden by the system-dependent user interface,
 * in case the data source is not a stdio stream or some other special
 * condition applies.  Note, however, that this capability only applies for
 * JFIF or similar serial-access JPEG file formats.  The input file control
 * module for a random-access format such as TIFF/JPEG would most likely
 * override the read_jpeg_data method with its own routine.

/* Default parameter setup for decompression.
 *
 * User interfaces that don't choose to use this routine must do their
 * own setup of all these parameters.  Alternately, you can call this
 * to establish defaults and then alter parameters selectively.  This
 * is the recommended approach since, if we add any new parameters,
 * your code will still work (they'll be set to reasonable defaults).
 *
 * standard_buffering should be TRUE to cause an input buffer to be allocated
 * (the normal case); if FALSE, the user interface must provide a buffer.
 * This option is most useful in the case that the buffer must not be freed
 * at the end of an image.  (For example, when reading a sequence of images
 * from a single file, the remaining data in the buffer represents the
 * start of the next image and mustn't be discarded.)  To handle this,
 * allocate the input buffer yourself at startup, WITHOUT using alloc_small
 * (probably a direct call to malloc() instead).  Then pass FALSE on each
 * call to j_d_defaults to ensure the buffer state is not modified.
 *
 * If the source of the JPEG data is not a stdio stream, override the
 * read_jpeg_data method with your own routine after calling j_d_defaults.
 * You can still use the standard buffer if it's appropriate.
 *
 * CAUTION: if you want to decompress multiple images per run, it's necessary
 * to call j_d_defaults before *each* call to jpeg_decompress, since subsidiary
 * structures like the quantization tables are automatically freed during
 * cleanup.
