What about allowing cut & paste in entries, etc.?

Should be able to specify the background color for messages (and other things, I guess)?

initmenubar is missing

Should init functions should allow you to change the kind of a panel?
	(I think this is too hard.)
Should init functions work even when the button is active?
	(Maybe not.)

textwin.c needs some work.
Real bugs:
	tw_setloc	to locate newlines compatibly with the frame library
Efficiency problems:
	twpt2rune	use binary search instead of linear
	tw_draw		collapse calls to string, where possible
	twreplace	make use of onscreen text below the insertion
	twscroll	do something other than redraw the whole screen
	tw_moveup	not tested
	tw_movedn	not tested
