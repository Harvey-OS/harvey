Welcome to Harvey, we are delighted that you are interested in the project.

- Take a look at the [Getting started](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki/Getting-Started) guide on how to get Harvey and how to play around with it.
- You enjoyed playing with Harvey and you want to help out? Great! Take a look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/blob/master/.github/CONTIRIBUTING.md) where we cover Harvey standards for contributions to ensure Harvey codebase stays in good shape.
- We also cover a wide variety of topics on our [wiki](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki) and [apex's wiki](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/apex/wiki).
- If the information you are looking for doesn't exist on the wiki, ask the [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/harvey) for help, it's where most of the conversation for development happens.
- [Man Pages](https://sevki.io/harvey/sys/man/1/0intro) are where you can read man pages from head of the repo.
