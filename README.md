# Harvey: A distributed operating system

Welcome to Harvey, we are delighted that you are interested in the
project.

## What is harvey?

Harvey is a distributed operating system. Itâ€™s most directly descended from [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs). This heritage spans from its distributed application architecture all the way down to much of its code. However, Harvey aims to be a more practical, general-purpose operating system, so it also uses ideas and code from other systems.

Starting July 2020, we will be replacing Harvey's user mode programs with programs written in Go. Many of these will come from [u-root](https://u-root.org).

### Getting started
