Welcome to Harvey, we are delighted that you are interested in the
project.

## What is harvey?

Harvey is a distributed operating system. It is direct descendant
of [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) which was originally
developed by the same group at Bell Labs that invented Unix and C.
