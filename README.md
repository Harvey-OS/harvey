# Harvey: A distributed operating system

Welcome to Harvey, we are delighted that you are interested in the
project.

## What is harvey?

Harvey is a distributed operating system. Itâ€™s most directly descended from [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs). This heritage spans from its distributed application architecture all the way down to much of its code. However, Harvey aims to be a more practical, general-purpose operating system, so it also uses ideas and code from other systems.
