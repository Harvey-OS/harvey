# Community

Our community is growing in members and interest.

Now Harvey has many people around its community, looking, experimenting,
testing... but in order to set main lines and goals, there is a bunch of people
in what we usual call "core team" making decisions, improving the system, testing
and resolving problems across all the source.
That doesn't mean you couldn't help us, through Gerrit you can submit patches,
new programs or improvements that we will review and possibly accept. Every hand
is welcome.

Below there are some links useful to participate in our community and become a Harvey enthusiast
that could be interesting for you. For writing in mailing list, you need to request
an invitation. Once you're in it, you can request an invitation to Slack channels.
