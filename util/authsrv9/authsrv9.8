.Nd Plan 9 authentication server for unix
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Authsrv9
is a unix implementation of a part of the Plan 9 authentication
service.  See the bugs section for the limitations.  Authsrv9 issues
authentication tickets to clients.  These tickets can be used to
authenticate to a server that is in the same authentication domain
as the authentication server.  For more information on the protocol
and service, read the Plan 9 manual pages
.Xr authsrv 6
and
.Xr authsrv 8 .
.Pp
The authentication id (often `bootes') is read from
.Pa /auth/authid
at startup.  The authentication domain is read from
.Pa /auth/authdom .
The file /auth/badusers contains a list (one user per line, newline
required) of users not allowed to authenticate to remote servers.
All other information about users is in the directory
.Pa /auth/users/username ,
with username replaced by the name of the user.  This directory
holds the following files:
.Pa key
(a 7-byte DES key),
.Pa expire
(either
the string "never" or an expiration timestamp (unix epoch timestamp
in ascii, newline forbidden), and
.Pa status
(the string "ok" indicates an
enabled user, the string "disabled" indicates a disabled user).  If
a user has expired or is not enabled, the authentication server
hands out unusable tickets.
.Pp
Authsrv is meant to be run from
.Xr inetd 8 .
Since users DES keys are stored in plain files without protection other
than standard file permission checking, care should be taken to
keep these files away from prying eyes.
.Pp
Successful and failed ticket requests and password change requests
are logged to syslog, under the authentication facility.  Authsrv9
can write more debug messages there by setting the
.Fl d
flag.  NOTE: this will write decrypted ticket requests (containing nonce keys) to syslog.
.Sh SEE ALSO
The program `passtokey' to generate keys from passwords.  From Plan 9:
.Xr authsrv(6) ,
.Xr authsrv(8) .

All files are in the public domain.
.Sh BUGS
Only regular ticket requests, and password change requests are
implemented.  Other authentication methods (e.g. challenge/response
(as used by telnet), and those based on the "Inferno/APOP" secret)
elicit a "not implemented" error message.
