     AAuutthhssrrvv99 is a unix implementation of a part of the Plan 9 authentication
     service.  See the bugs section for the limitations.  Authsrv9 issues
     authentication tickets to clients.  These tickets can be used to authen‐
     ticate to a server that is in the same authentication domain as the
     authentication server.  For more information on the protocol and service,
     read the Plan 9 manual pages authsrv(6) and authsrv(8).

     The authentication id (often `bootes') is read from _/_a_u_t_h_/_a_u_t_h_i_d at
     startup.  The authentication domain is read from _/_a_u_t_h_/_a_u_t_h_d_o_m.  The file
     /auth/badusers contains a list (one user per line, newline required) of
     users not allowed to authenticate to remote servers.  All other informa‐
     tion about users is in the directory _/_a_u_t_h_/_u_s_e_r_s_/_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, with username
     replaced by the name of the user.  This directory holds the following
     files: _k_e_y (a 7-byte DES key), _e_x_p_i_r_e (either the string "never" or an
     expiration timestamp (unix epoch timestamp in ascii, newline forbidden),
     and _s_t_a_t_u_s (the string "ok" indicates an enabled user, the string "dis‐
     abled" indicates a disabled user).  If a user has expired or is not
     enabled, the authentication server hands out unusable tickets.

     Authsrv is meant to be run from inetd(8).  Since users DES keys are
     stored in plain files without protection other than standard file permis‐
     sion checking, care should be taken to keep these files away from prying
     eyes.

     Successful and failed ticket requests and password change requests are
     logged to syslog, under the authentication facility.  Authsrv9 can write
     more debug messages there by setting the --dd flag.  NOTE: this will write
     decrypted ticket requests (containing nonce keys) to syslog.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     The program `passtokey' to generate keys from passwords.  From Plan 9:
     authsrv(6), authsrv(8).

     Mechiel Lukkien, <mechiel@xs4all.nl> or <mechiel@ueber.net>.  All files
     are in the public domain.

BBUUGGSS
     Only regular ticket requests, and password change requests are imple‐
     mented.  Other authentication methods (e.g. challenge/response (as used
     by telnet), and those based on the "Inferno/APOP" secret) elicit a "not
     implemented" error message.
