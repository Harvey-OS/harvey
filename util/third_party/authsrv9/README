# intro

this provides a plan 9 authentication service (auth/authsrv).  one
version is for unix, written in c and not depending on external
libraries.  the other version is for inferno, written in limbo.


# install

for the unix code:
execute "make".  see the manual page authsrv9.8 for more information.

for the inferno code:
modify "mkconfig" if you don't have $ROOT set, execute "mk install".
see the manual page authsrv9(8) for more information.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
