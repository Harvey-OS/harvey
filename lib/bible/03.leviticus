LEV 5:1  And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

LEV 6:3  Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:
LEV 6:4  Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

LEV 6:10  And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
LEV 6:11  And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
LEV 6:12  And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

LEV 6:22  And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.

LEV 6:24  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 6:25  Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.
LEV 6:26  The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
LEV 6:27  Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

LEV 7:2  In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
LEV 7:3  And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
LEV 7:4  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:

LEV 7:12  If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
LEV 7:13  Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
LEV 7:14  And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.
LEV 7:15  And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
LEV 7:16  But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
LEV 7:17  But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
LEV 7:18  And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
LEV 7:19  And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.

LEV 7:24  And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
LEV 7:25  For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
LEV 7:26  Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
LEV 7:27  Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
LEV 7:28  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 7:30  His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

LEV 7:32  And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
LEV 7:33  He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
LEV 7:34  For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
LEV 7:35  This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;
LEV 7:36  Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.
LEV 7:37  This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
LEV 7:38  Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
LEV 8:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 8:3  And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
LEV 8:4  And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

LEV 8:8  And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
LEV 8:9  And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 8:10  And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
LEV 8:11  And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.
LEV 8:12  And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
LEV 8:13  And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 8:14  And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
LEV 8:15  And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
LEV 8:16  And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.
LEV 8:17  But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 8:18  And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
LEV 8:19  And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV 8:20  And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
LEV 8:21  And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 8:22  And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
LEV 8:23  And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
LEV 8:24  And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV 8:25  And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
LEV 8:26  And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
LEV 8:27  And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.
LEV 8:28  And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
LEV 8:29  And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 8:30  And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
LEV 8:31  And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
LEV 8:32  And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
LEV 8:33  And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
LEV 8:34  As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
LEV 8:35  Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
LEV 8:36  So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
LEV 9:1  And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
LEV 9:2  And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
LEV 9:3  And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
LEV 9:4  Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.
LEV 9:5  And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
LEV 9:6  And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
LEV 9:7  And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
LEV 9:8  Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
LEV 9:9  And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
LEV 9:10  But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 9:11  And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
LEV 9:12  And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
LEV 9:13  And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
LEV 9:14  And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV 9:15  And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
LEV 9:16  And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
LEV 9:17  And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
LEV 9:18  He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
LEV 9:19  And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:
LEV 9:20  And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
LEV 9:21  And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
LEV 9:22  And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
LEV 9:23  And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
LEV 9:24  And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
LEV 10:1  And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
LEV 10:2  And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
LEV 10:3  Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
LEV 10:4  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
LEV 10:5  So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
LEV 10:6  And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
LEV 10:7  And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
LEV 10:8  And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,
LEV 10:9  Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
LEV 10:10  And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
LEV 10:11  And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
LEV 10:12  And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
LEV 10:13  And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
LEV 10:14  And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
LEV 10:15  The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
LEV 10:16  And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,
LEV 10:17  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
LEV 10:18  Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
LEV 10:19  And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
LEV 10:20  And when Moses heard that, he was content.
LEV 11:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
LEV 11:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
LEV 11:3  Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
LEV 11:4  Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
LEV 11:5  And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
LEV 11:6  And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
LEV 11:7  And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
LEV 11:8  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
LEV 11:9  These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
LEV 11:10  And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:
LEV 11:11  They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
LEV 11:12  Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV 11:13  And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
LEV 11:14  And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;
LEV 11:15  Every raven after his kind;
LEV 11:16  And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
LEV 11:17  And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
LEV 11:18  And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
LEV 11:19  And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
LEV 11:20  All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV 11:21  Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;
LEV 11:22  Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
LEV 11:23  But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV 11:24  And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.
LEV 11:25  And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
LEV 11:26  The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
LEV 11:27  And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.
LEV 11:28  And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
LEV 11:29  These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,
LEV 11:30  And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
LEV 11:31  These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.
LEV 11:32  And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.
LEV 11:33  And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
LEV 11:34  Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
LEV 11:35  And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.
LEV 11:36  Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.
LEV 11:37  And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.
LEV 11:38  But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.
LEV 11:39  And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.
LEV 11:40  And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
LEV 11:41  And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
LEV 11:42  Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
LEV 11:43  Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
LEV 11:44  For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
LEV 11:45  For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
LEV 11:46  This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:
LEV 11:47  To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
LEV 12:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 12:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
LEV 12:3  And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
LEV 12:4  And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
LEV 12:5  But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.
LEV 12:6  And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:
LEV 12:7  Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.
LEV 12:8  And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
LEV 13:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,
LEV 13:2  When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
LEV 13:3  And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
LEV 13:4  If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:
LEV 13:5  And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
LEV 13:6  And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
LEV 13:7  But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again.
LEV 13:8  And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.
LEV 13:9  When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
LEV 13:10  And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;
LEV 13:11  It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.
LEV 13:12  And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;
LEV 13:13  Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
LEV 13:14  But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
LEV 13:15  And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.
LEV 13:16  Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;
LEV 13:17  And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.
LEV 13:18  The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,
LEV 13:19  And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;
LEV 13:20  And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
LEV 13:21  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
LEV 13:22  And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
LEV 13:23  But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV 13:24  Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;
LEV 13:25  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
LEV 13:26  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
LEV 13:27  And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
LEV 13:28  And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.
LEV 13:29  If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
LEV 13:30  Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.
LEV 13:31  And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:
LEV 13:32  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;
LEV 13:33  He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:
LEV 13:34  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
LEV 13:35  But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
LEV 13:36  Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.
LEV 13:37  But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV 13:38  If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
LEV 13:39  Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.
LEV 13:40  And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.
LEV 13:41  And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.
LEV 13:42  And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
LEV 13:43  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
LEV 13:44  He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.
LEV 13:45  And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
LEV 13:46  All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.
LEV 13:47  The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
LEV 13:48  Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
LEV 13:49  And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:
LEV 13:50  And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:
LEV 13:51  And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
LEV 13:52  He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV 13:53  And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
LEV 13:54  Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
LEV 13:55  And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.
LEV 13:56  And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
LEV 13:57  And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
LEV 13:58  And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
LEV 13:59  This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
LEV 14:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 14:2  This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:
LEV 14:3  And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;
LEV 14:4  Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
LEV 14:5  And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
LEV 14:6  As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
LEV 14:7  And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
LEV 14:8  And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
LEV 14:9  But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

LEV 14:11  And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
LEV 14:12  And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:
LEV 14:13  And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:
LEV 14:14  And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
LEV 14:15  And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:
LEV 14:16  And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:
LEV 14:17  And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:

LEV 14:19  And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:
LEV 14:20  And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
LEV 14:21  And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;
LEV 14:22  And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.
LEV 14:23  And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD.
LEV 14:24  And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:
LEV 14:25  And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

LEV 14:27  And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:
LEV 14:28  And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:
LEV 14:29  And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD.
LEV 14:30  And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;
LEV 14:31  Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.
LEV 14:32  This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.
LEV 14:33  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
LEV 14:34  When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
LEV 14:35  And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:
LEV 14:36  Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
LEV 14:37  And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;
LEV 14:38  Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
LEV 14:39  And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
LEV 14:40  Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
LEV 14:41  And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
LEV 14:42  And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.
LEV 14:43  And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;
LEV 14:44  Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
LEV 14:45  And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
LEV 14:46  Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
LEV 14:47  And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
LEV 14:48  And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
LEV 14:49  And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
LEV 14:50  And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
LEV 14:51  And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
LEV 14:52  And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
LEV 14:53  But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.
LEV 14:54  This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
LEV 14:55  And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
LEV 14:56  And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
LEV 14:57  To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
LEV 15:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
LEV 15:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.

LEV 15:32  This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;
LEV 15:33  And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
LEV 16:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;
LEV 16:2  And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
LEV 16:3  Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
LEV 16:4  He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

LEV 16:9  And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.
LEV 16:10  But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
LEV 16:11  And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:
LEV 16:12  And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:
LEV 16:13  And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
LEV 16:14  And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
LEV 16:15  Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
LEV 16:16  And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

LEV 16:23  And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

LEV 16:25  And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
LEV 16:26  And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
LEV 16:27  And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

LEV 16:30  For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
LEV 16:31  It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.

LEV 16:34  And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.
LEV 17:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 17:2  Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,
LEV 17:3  What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,
LEV 17:4  And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
LEV 17:5  To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.
LEV 17:6  And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
LEV 17:7  And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.
LEV 17:8  And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
LEV 17:9  And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
LEV 17:10  And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
LEV 17:11  For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
LEV 17:12  Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
LEV 17:13  And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
LEV 17:14  For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
LEV 17:15  And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
LEV 17:16  But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.

LEV 18:4  Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.
LEV 18:5  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.
LEV 18:6  None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

LEV 18:19  Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
LEV 18:20  Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
LEV 18:21  And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
LEV 18:22  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
LEV 18:23  Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
LEV 18:24  Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
LEV 18:25  And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
LEV 18:26  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
LEV 18:27  (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)
LEV 18:28  That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.
LEV 18:29  For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.
LEV 18:30  Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 19:12  And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

LEV 19:14  Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.
LEV 19:15  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
LEV 19:16  Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the LORD.

LEV 19:25  And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.

LEV 20:3  And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
LEV 20:4  And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:
LEV 20:5  Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
LEV 20:6  And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

LEV 20:17  And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

LEV 20:23  And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

LEV 20:25  Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
LEV 20:26  And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.
LEV 20:27  A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

LEV 21:19  Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
LEV 21:20  Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
LEV 21:21  No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
LEV 21:22  He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
LEV 21:23  Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

LEV 22:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 22:2  Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.
LEV 22:3  Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
LEV 22:4  What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
LEV 22:5  Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
LEV 22:6  The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
LEV 22:7  And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.
LEV 22:8  That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.
LEV 22:9  They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
LEV 22:10  There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

LEV 22:14  And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.
LEV 22:15  And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

LEV 22:17  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 22:18  Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
LEV 22:19  Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
LEV 22:20  But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
LEV 22:21  And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
LEV 22:22  Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

LEV 22:24  Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
LEV 22:25  Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
LEV 22:26  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 22:27  When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
LEV 22:28  And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
LEV 22:29  And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.
LEV 22:30  On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.
LEV 22:31  Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.
LEV 22:32  Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,
LEV 22:33  That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
LEV 23:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 23:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

LEV 23:9  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

LEV 23:11  And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
LEV 23:12  And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

LEV 23:14  And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV 23:15  And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
LEV 23:16  Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
LEV 23:17  Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

LEV 23:19  Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
LEV 23:20  And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

LEV 23:22  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
LEV 23:23  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 23:24  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
LEV 23:25  Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
LEV 23:26  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 23:27  Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
LEV 23:28  And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
LEV 23:29  For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
LEV 23:30  And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
LEV 23:31  Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

LEV 24:8  Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.

LEV 24:10  And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
LEV 24:11  And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
LEV 24:12  And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
LEV 24:13  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 24:14  Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
LEV 24:15  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
LEV 24:16  And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.

LEV 24:18  And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
LEV 24:19  And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
LEV 24:20  Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
LEV 24:21  And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
LEV 24:22  Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

LEV 25:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
LEV 25:3  Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
LEV 25:4  But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
LEV 25:5  That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
LEV 25:6  And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.
LEV 25:7  And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
LEV 25:8  And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
LEV 25:9  Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
LEV 25:10  And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
LEV 25:11  A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
LEV 25:12  For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
LEV 25:13  In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
LEV 25:14  And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
LEV 25:15  According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
LEV 25:16  According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
LEV 25:17  Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.
LEV 25:18  Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
LEV 25:19  And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
LEV 25:20  And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
LEV 25:21  Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
LEV 25:22  And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
LEV 25:23  The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
LEV 25:24  And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
LEV 25:25  If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
LEV 25:26  And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
LEV 25:27  Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
LEV 25:28  But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
LEV 25:29  And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
LEV 25:30  And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
LEV 25:31  But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
LEV 25:32  Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
LEV 25:33  And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
LEV 25:34  But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
LEV 25:35  And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
LEV 25:36  Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
LEV 25:37  Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
LEV 25:38  I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
LEV 25:39  And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
LEV 25:40  But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.
LEV 25:41  And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
LEV 25:42  For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
LEV 25:43  Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
LEV 25:44  Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
LEV 25:45  Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
LEV 25:46  And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
LEV 25:47  And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
LEV 25:48  After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
LEV 25:49  Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
LEV 25:50  And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
LEV 25:51  If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
LEV 25:52  And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
LEV 25:53  And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
LEV 25:54  And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.
LEV 25:55  For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
LEV 26:1  Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.
LEV 26:2  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
LEV 26:3  If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
LEV 26:4  Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
LEV 26:5  And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
LEV 26:6  And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
LEV 26:7  And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV 26:8  And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV 26:9  For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
LEV 26:10  And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
LEV 26:11  And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
LEV 26:12  And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
LEV 26:13  I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
LEV 26:14  But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
LEV 26:15  And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:
LEV 26:16  I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
LEV 26:17  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
LEV 26:18  And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
LEV 26:19  And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
LEV 26:20  And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
LEV 26:21  And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
LEV 26:22  I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.
LEV 26:23  And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
LEV 26:24  Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
LEV 26:25  And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
LEV 26:26  And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
LEV 26:27  And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
LEV 26:28  Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
LEV 26:29  And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
LEV 26:30  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
LEV 26:31  And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
LEV 26:32  And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
LEV 26:33  And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
LEV 26:34  Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
LEV 26:35  As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
LEV 26:36  And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
LEV 26:37  And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
LEV 26:38  And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
LEV 26:39  And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
LEV 26:40  If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
LEV 26:41  And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
LEV 26:42  Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
LEV 26:43  The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
LEV 26:44  And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.
LEV 26:45  But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
LEV 26:46  These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
LEV 27:1  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
LEV 27:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.
LEV 27:3  And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
LEV 27:4  And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
LEV 27:5  And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
LEV 27:6  And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
LEV 27:7  And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
LEV 27:8  But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
LEV 27:9  And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
LEV 27:10  He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
LEV 27:11  And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
LEV 27:12  And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
LEV 27:13  But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
LEV 27:14  And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
LEV 27:15  And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
LEV 27:16  And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
LEV 27:17  If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
LEV 27:18  But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
LEV 27:19  And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
LEV 27:20  And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
LEV 27:21  But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
LEV 27:22  And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;
LEV 27:23  Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
LEV 27:24  In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
LEV 27:25  And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
LEV 27:26  Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.
LEV 27:27  And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
LEV 27:28  Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.
LEV 27:29  None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
LEV 27:30  And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.
LEV 27:31  And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
LEV 27:32  And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
LEV 27:33  He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
LEV 27:34  These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
