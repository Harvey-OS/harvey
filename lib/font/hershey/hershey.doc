This file provides a brief description of the contents of the Occidental
Hershey Font Files. For a complete listing of the fonts in hard copy, order
NBS Special Publication 424, "A contribution to computer typesetting 
techniques: Tables of Coordinates for Hershey's Repertory of Occidental
Type Fonts and Graphic Symbols". You can get it from NTIS (phone number is
+1 703 487 4763) for less than twenty dollars US.

Basic Glyph (symbol) data:

        hersh.oc1       - numbers 1 to 1199
        hersh.oc2       - numbers 1200 to 2499
        hersh.oc3       - numbers 2500 to 3199
        hersh.oc4       - numbers 3200 to 3999

        These four files contain approximately 19 different fonts in
the A-Z alphabet plus greek and cyrillic, along with hundreds of special
symbols, described generically below.

        There are also four files of Oriental fonts (hersh.or[1-4]). These
files contain symbols from three Japanese alphabets (Kanji, Hiragana, and
Katakana). It is unknown what other symbols may be contained therein, nor
is it known what order the symbols are in (I don't know Japanese!).

ASCII sequence translation files:

        The Hershey glyphs, while in a particular order, are not in an
        ASCII sequence. I have provided translation files that give the
        sequence of glyph numbers that will most closely approximate the
        ASCII printing sequence (from space through ~, with the degree
        circle tacked on at the end) for each of the above fonts:

        File names are made up of fffffftt.hmp,

                where ffffff is the font style, one of:
                        roman   Roman
                        greek   Greek
                        italic  Italic
                        script  Script
                        cyril   Cyrillic (some characters not placed in
                                           the ASCII sequence)
                        gothgr  Gothic German
                        gothgb  Gothic English
                        gothit  Gothic Italian

                and tt is the font type, one of:
                    p       Plain (very small, no lower case)
                    s       Simplex (plain, normal size, no serifs)
                    d       Duplex (normal size, no serifs, doubled lines)
                    c       Complex (normal size, serifs, doubled lines)
                    t       Triplex (normal size, serifs, tripled lines)
                    cs      Complex Small (Complex, smaller than normal size)

The three sizes are coded with particular base line (bottom of a capital
        letter) and cap line (top of a capital letter) values for 'y':

        Size            Base Line       Cap Line

        Very Small         -5              +4 
        Small              -6              +7
        Normal             -9              +12

        (Note: some glyphs in the 'Very Small' fonts are actually 'Small')

The top line and bottom line, which are normally used to define vertical
        spacing, are not given. Maybe somebody can determine appropriate
        values for these!

The left line and right line, which are used to define horizontal spacing,
        are provided with each character in the database.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format of Hershey glyphs:

5 bytes	- glyphnumber
3 bytes	- length of data  length in 16-bit words including left&right numbers
1 byte	- x value of left margin
1 byte	- x value of right margin
(length*2)-2 bytes	- stroke data

left&right margins and stroke data are biased by the value of the letter 'R'
Subtract the letter 'R' to get the data.

e.g. if the data byte is 'R', the data is 0
     if the data byte is 'T', the data is +2
     if the data byte is 'J', the data is -8

and so on...

The coordinate system is x-y, with the origin (0,0) in the center of the
glyph.  X increases to the right and y increases *down*.

The stroke data is pairs of bytes, one byte for x followed by one byte for y.

A ' R' in the stroke data indicates a 'lift pen and move' instruction.
