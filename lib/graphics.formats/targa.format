	Here's a file documenting the targa format:



======================================================================================
This file has been created to satisfy numerous requests for information
on Targa image file formats.  The information has been taken from
Appendix C of the Truevision Technical Guide.  Requests for further
information could be directed to:

           AT&T
           Electronic Photography and Imaging Center
           2002 Wellesley Ave.

This document does not pretend to be complete, but it does pretend to
be accurate.  If you discover any finger checks or erroneous information
please let me know, ( David McDuffee, 75530,2626), and I will upload the
corrections.  Thanks.

The lack of completeness is due to the fact that the Targa recognizes
over half a dozen image file formats, some of which are more widely
used than others.  I have chosen to re-key the details on only those
formats which I actually use.  Again, if you want to know more about
formats not covered here, you could contact your Truevision representative.

All Targa formats are identified by a Data Type field, which is a one
byte binary integer located in byte three of the file.  The various
file types specified by this field are as follows:

       0  -  No image data included.
       1  -  Uncompressed, color-mapped images.
       2  -  Uncompressed, RGB images.
       3  -  Uncompressed, black and white images.
       9  -  Runlength encoded color-mapped images.
      10  -  Runlength encoded RGB images.
      11  -  Compressed, black and white images.
      32  -  Compressed color-mapped data, using Huffman, Delta, and
                    runlength encoding.
      33  -  Compressed color-mapped data, using Huffman, Delta, and
                    runlength encoding.  4-pass quadtree-type process.

This document will describe only four formats: 1, 2, 9, and 10.

|        |        |  the Color Map Specification, which describes the          |
|        |        |  size of each entry and the number of entries.             |
|        |        |  Each color map entry is 2, 3, or 4 bytes.                 |
|        |        |  Unused bits are assumed to specify attribute bits.        |

|        |        |  for green, 1 byte for red, and 1 byte of attribute        |
|        |        |  information, in that order.

|        |        |  The 2 byte entry is broken down as follows:               |
|        |        |  ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB, where each letter represents a bit.    |
|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |

|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |

|        |        |  Contains a free-form identification field of the length   |
|        |        |  specified in byte 1 of the image record.  It's usually    |
|        |        |  omitted ( length in byte 1 = 0 ), but can be up to 255    |
|        |        |  characters.  If more identification information is        |
|        |        |  required, it can be stored after the image data.          |

|        |        |  RGB color information for the pixels is stored in         |
|        |        |  packets.  There are two types of packets:  Run-length     |
|        |        |  encoded packets, and raw packets.  Both have a 1-byte     |
|        |        |  header, identifying the type of packet and specifying a   |
|        |        |  count, followed by a variable-length body.                |
|        |        |  The high-order bit of the header is "1" for the           |
|        |        |  run length packet, and "0" for the raw packet.            |

|        |        |      |       |   run size would be 128.               |    |

|        |        |  For the run length packet, the header is followed by      |
|        |        |  a single color value, which is assumed to be repeated     |
|        |        |  the number of times specified in the header.  The         |
|        |        |  packet may cross scan lines ( begin on one line and end   |
|        |        |  on the next ).                                            |

|        |        |  The color entries themselves are two bytes, three bytes,  |
|        |        |  or four bytes ( for Targa 16, 24, and 32 ), and are       |
|        |        |  broken down as follows:                                   |
|        |        |                                                            |

|        |        |  ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB, where each letter represents a bit.    |
|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |
|        |        |                                                            |
|        |        |  The 3 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  and red.                                                  |
|        |        |                                                            |
|        |        |  The 4 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  red, and attribute.  For faster speed (because of the     |
|        |        |  hardware of the Targa board itself), Targa 24 image are   |
|        |        |  sometimes stored as Targa 32 images.                      |
