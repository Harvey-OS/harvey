CGM is:

	A functional specification (semantic standard) for encoding
	computer graphics images for redisplay on one or several supported
	device types, with three encoding (syntactic) standards, one a
	character encoding for minimal size and ease of transmission, one a
	binary encoding for speed of access, and one a clear text encoding
	for human readability and easy editing.  It is primarily oriented
	toward stroke drawn graphics, but includes raster bitmap encodings.
	It comprises about 300 pages, softbound.  CGM is both an American
	National Standard and an ISO international standard.

CGM is not:

	A 3D standard, a CAD/CAM data transfer standard (IGES is), nor is it
	a graphic object model data storage standard.

CGM is called:

	ANSI X3.122-1986
	American National Standard for Information Systems -
	Computer Graphics - Metafile for the Storage and Transfer of
	Picture Description Information

CGM is available from:

	American National Standards Institute, Inc.
	1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018

CGM supports, and is used by, GKS (the Graphical Kernal Standard), but is
independent from it.  CGM is also used as a "least common denominator"
picture transfer mechanism among many commercial, off the shelf business
packages, e.g. Harvard Graphics.

There may well be extensions since the 1986 document, but I am not aware of
them.  In particular, support for GKS-3D is sorely needed.

Jef, perhaps this should go in your weekly listing; it seems to be asked
very often.  Also, can anyone supply the order number for ANSI, New York?
