    The NASA Science Data Systems Standards Office (NSDSSO) has been
established to serve the space science communities in evolving cost effective,
interoperable, data systems. The NSDSSO performs a number of functions designed
to facilitate the recognition, development, adoption, and use of standards by
the space science communities.
    Approval of an NSDSSO Standard requires verification by the NSDSSO that the
following requirements have been met: consensus by the technical panel; proper
adjudication of the comments received from the targeted space and Earth
science community; and conformance to the accreditation process.
    An NSDSSO standard represents the consensus of the technical panel convened
by the NASA Science Data Systems Standards Office (NSDSSO) of the National
Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA). Consensus is established when the NSDSSO Accreditation
Panel determines that substantial agreement has been reached by the Technical
Panel. However consensus does not necessarily imply that all members were in
full agreement with every item in the standard. NSDSSO standards are not
binding as published, however they may serve as a basis for mandatory standards
when adopted by NASA or other organizations.
    An NSDSSO standard may be revised at any time depending on developments in
the areas covered by the standard. Also, within five years from the date of its
issuance, this standard will be reviewed by the NSDSSO to determine whether it
should 1) remain in effect without change, 2) be changed to reflect the impact
of new technologies or new requirements, or 3) be retired or cancelled.
    The Technical Panel which developed this standard consisted of the
following members:
 
 
 
      Robert J. Hanisch, Chair           Space Telescope Science Institute
      Barry M. Schlesinger, Secretary    ST Systems Corporation
      Lee E. Brotzman                    ST Systems Corporation
      Edward Kemper                      ST Systems Corporation
      Peter Teuben                       University of Maryland

Introduction
 
 
 
The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) evolved out of the recognition that
a standard format was needed for transferring astronomical data from one
installation to another. The original form, or Basic FITS, was designed for the
transfer of images and consisted of a binary array, usually multidimensional,
preceded by an ASCII text header with information describing the structure and
contents of the array. The FITS concept was later expanded to accommodate more
complex data structures. For example, a new structure for image transfer called
random groups was defined in which the data consists of a series of arrays,
with each array accompanied by a set of associated parameters. These structures
were formally endorsed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in
1982[1]. Provisions for data structures other than simple arrays or groups were
later made. These structures appear in extensions, consisting of an ASCII
header followed by the data structure it describes. One particular extension
structure, ASCII Tables, was formally approved by the IAU in 1988. At the same
time, a set of rules governing all extensions was endorsed, to ensure that FITS
readers encountering an unfamiliar extension would be able to identify it,
interpret it, and pass on to the next.
    FITS was originally designed and defined for 9-track half-inch magnetic
tape. However, as improvements in technology have brought forward other data
storage and data distribution media, it has generally been agreed that the FITS
structure is to be understood as a logical structure, and not defined in terms
of the physical characteristics of any particular data storage medium or media.

Overview
 
 
 
1.1        Purpose
 
 
This standard formally defines the FITS format for data structuring and
exchange. It is intended as a formal codification of the FITS structure that
has been endorsed by the IAU for transfer of astronomical data, as described in
four published papers [2,3,4,5] and in a formal agreement [6] endorsed by the
IAU FITS Working Group under Commission 5. Minor ambiguities and
inconsistencies in FITS as described in the original papers are eliminated.
 
 
 
1.2        Scope
 
 
This standard specifies the structure and content of FITS data sets. It
specifies the content and organization of the header and data for all standard
FITS formats: Basic FITS, the ASCII tables extension, and the random groups
structure. It also specifies minimum structural requirements for new extensions
and general principles governing the creation of new extensions. For headers,
it specifies the proper syntax for card images and defines required and
reserved keywords. For data, it specifies character and value representations.
It defines the general rules to which new extensions are required to conform.
 
 
 
1.3        Applicability
 
 
All spacecraft projects and astrophysics data archives under the management of
the Astrophysics Division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
are required to make processed data available to users in the format defined by
this standard, unless the Astrophysics Division specifically determines
otherwise. The IAU has recommended that all astronomical computer facilities
support FITS for the interchange of binary data.  This standard may also be
used

2_________________________________________________________SECTION_1.___OVERVIEW
 
 
 
used to define the format for data transport in other disciplines, as may be
determined by the appropriate authorities.
 
 
 
1.4        Organization  and  Recommendations
 
 
Following the definitions in Section 3, this document describes the overall
organization of a FITS data set and the rules for creating new FITS extensions
in Section 4. Subsequent sections describe the contents of FITS files. Section
5 describes headers, including the required keywords and the conditions under
which each is required; also, reserved keywords are specified. Section 6
describes how data are represented, and Section 7 describes data structures.
Each section contains information relevant to all FITS formats. Throughout the
document, deprecation of structures or syntax is noted where relevant. Data
sets containing such constructs are valid FITS, but these constructs should not
be used in new data sets; the old data sets using them remain standard because
of the principle that no FITS structure, once valid, shall ever become invalid.
    Although it is part of the FITS standard, the random groups structure has
not been widely used. New formats under development will replace it, and use of
it is discouraged. Consequently, it is described in Appendix A rather than in
the main body of the standard. One new format, 3D binary tables, is described
for informational purposes in Appendix B, which is not part of the formal
standard.
    While FITS is designed as a logical format, the astronomical community has
developed recommendations for its expression on various physical media. The
accepted recommendations are provided in Appendix C as a guide to FITS
practices, but they are not part of this standard. Appendix D gives a tabular
summary of the FITS keywords.

Data   Set   Organization
 
 
4.1        Overall  Structure
 
 
A FITS file shall be composed of the following FITS elements, in the order
listed:
 
 
     o  Primary HDU
 
 
     o  Extensions (optional)
 
 
     o  Special records (optional)
 
 
     Each FITS element shall consist of an integral number of FITS logical
records. The primary HDU shall start with the first record of the FITS file.
The first record of each subsequent FITS element shall be the record
immediately following the last record of the preceding FITS element. The size
of a FITS logical record shall be 23040 bits, corresponding to 2880 8-bit
bytes.
 
 
4.2        FITS  Element  Structure
 
 
The primary HDU and every extension shall consist of an integral number of
header records consisting of ASCII text, which may be followed by an integral
number of data records. The first record of data shall be the record
immediately following the last record of the header.
 
 
4.3        Primary  Header  and  Data
 
 
The first component of a FITS data set shall be the primary header. The primary
header may, but need not be, followed by primary data. The presence or absence
of primary data shall be indicated by the value of the NAXIS keyword in the
primary header (Section 5.2.1.1).
 
_______________________________________________________________________________

code. All header records shall consist of 36 card images. Card images without
information shall be filled with ASCII blanks (hexadecimal 20).
 
 
4.3.2       Primary  Data
 
 
The primary data, if present, may be either in Basic FITS array format or
random groups format. In Basic FITS format, the primary data shall consist of a
single data array of 1-999 dimensions. If the data array does not fill the
final record, the remaining storage locations shall be filled with zero values
with the same data representation as the values in the array. Random groups
format, which this document deprecates, is described in Appendix A.
 
 
4.4        Extensions
 
 
All extensions, whether or not described in this standard, shall fulfill the
following requirements to be in conformance with this FITS standard.
 
 
4.4.1       Requirements  for  Conforming  Extensions
 
 
4.4.1.1       Identity
 
 
Each extension shall have a unique name, specified in the header according to
the syntax codified in Section 5.2.1.2. To preclude conflict, extension names
must be registered with the NSDSSO or IAU Commission 5 who will coordinate name
allocations.
 
 
4.4.1.2       Size Specification
 
 
The total number of bits in the data of each extension shall be specified in
the header for that extension, in the manner prescribed in Section 5.2.1.2.

No extension shall be constructed that invalidates existing FITS data sets.
 
 
4.4.2       Standard  Extensions
 
 
A standard extension shall be a conforming extension whose structure and
content are completely specified in this standard. Only one FITS format shall
be approved for each type of data organization. Each standard extension shall
have a unique name.
 
 
4.4.3       Order  of  Extensions
 
 
Standard extensions and other conforming extensions may appear in any order in
a FITS data set.
 
 
4.5        Special  Records
 
 
The first 8 bytes of special records must not contain the string "XTENSION" or
the string "SIMPLE  ". The records must have the standard FITS 23040-bit record
length. The contents of special records are not otherwise specified by this
standard.

Headers
 
 
5.1        Card  Images
 
 
5.1.1       Syntax
 
 
Header card images shall consist of a keyword, an optional value, and an
optional comment. If a value is present, column 9 shall contain the symbol "=",
column 10 shall be blank, and columns 11-80 shall be as specified in the
remainder of Section 5.2. If no value is present, column 9 may contain any
ASCII text except the symbol "=", and columns 10-80 may contain any ASCII text.
 
 
5.1.2       Components
 
 
5.1.2.1       Keyword (bytes 1-8)
 
 
The keyword shall be a left justified, 8-character, blank filled, ASCII string
with no embedded blanks. All digits (hexadecimal 30 to 39, "0123456789") and
upper case Latin alphabetic characters (hexadecimal 41 to 5A, "ABCDEFG HIJKLMN
OPQRST UVWXYZ") are permitted; no lower case characters shall be used. The
underscore (hexadecimal 60, "_") and hyphen (hexadecimal 2D, "-") are also
permitted. No other characters are permitted. If the keyword itself requires
less than eight characters it must be filled with ASCII blanks (hexadecimal
20). The value and comments field on a card image may be restricted for
particular keywords.
 
 
5.1.2.2       Value Indicator (bytes 9-10)
 
 
This field shall contain an ASCII "= " for keywords with an associated value
field. If there is no associated value field, byte 9 may not contain "="
(hexadecimal 3D); otherwise, this field may contain any ASCII character text.

5.1.2.3       Value/Comment
 
 
This field, when used, shall contain the value, if any, of the keyword followed
by optional comments. Separation of the value and comments by a slash
(hexadecimal 2F, "/"), and a space between the value and the slash are strongly
recommended. The value shall be the ASCII representation of a string or
constant, structured as specified in Section 5.3. The comment may contain any
printable 7-bit ASCII characters (hexadecimal 20 through 7E).
 
 
5.2        Keywords
 
 
5.2.1       Mandatory  Keywords
 
 
Mandatory keywords are required as described in the remainder of this
subsection. They may be used only as described in this standard.
 
 
5.2.1.1       Principal
 
 
Principal Mandatory keywords other than SIMPLE are required in all FITS
headers. The SIMPLE keyword is required in all primary headers and may not
appear elsewhere. The card images of any primary header must contain the
keywords shown in Table 5.1 in the order given.
 
                       1      SIMPLE

NAXIS Keyword      The value field shall contain an integer no greater than
999, representing the number of axes in an ordinary data array. A value of zero
signifies that no data follow the header.
 
 
NAXISn  Keywords   The value field shall contain an integer, representing the
number of positions along axis n of an ordinary data array. If NAXIS is equal
to 0, there should not be any NAXISn keywords.
 
 
END Keyword    This keyword has no associated value. Columns 9-80 shall be
blank.
 
 
5.2.1.2       Conforming Extensions
 
 
The use of FITS extensions requires the use of a single additional keyword in
the primary header.
 
 
EXTEND Keyword     If the FITS data set contains extensions, a card image with
the keyword EXTEND and the value field containing the logical value T must
appear in the primary header immediately after the last NAXISn card image, or,
if NAXIS=0, the NAXIS card image. The presence of this keyword with the value T
in the primary header does not require that extensions be present.
     The card images of any extension header must use the keywords defined in
Table 5.3 in the order specified. This organization is required for any
conforming extension, whether or not further specified in this standard.
     The total number of bits in the extension data array exclusive of the fill
described in Section 4.3.2 must be given by the following expression:

BLOCKED  Keyword   This keyword may be used only in the primary header. It must
appear immediately after the EXTEND card image, or if this card image is not
present, after the last NAXISn card image or the NAXIS card image with value
zero. Its presence with the required logical value of T advises that the
physical block size of the FITS data set on which it appears may be an integral
multiple of the logical record length. Physical block size and logical record
length may be equal even if this keyword is present or unequal if it is absent.
It is reserved primarily to prevent its use with other meanings. The issuance
of this standard deprecates the BLOCKED keyword.

5.2.2.5       Array Keywords
 
These keywords are used to describe the contents of a simple array, either
alone, or in a series of random groups. They are optional, but if they appear
in the header describing an array, they must be used as defined in this section
of this standard. They shall not be used in headers describing other structures
unless the meaning is the same as that for a primary array.
 
 
BSCALE  Keyword    This keyword shall be used, along with the BZERO keyword,
when the array pixel values are not the true physical values, to transform the
primary array values to the true physical values they represent, using the
linear transformation equation defined below. The value field shall contain a
floating point number representing the coefficient of the linear term in the
scaling equation, the ratio of physical value to array value at zero offset.
 
 
BZERO  Keyword     This keyword shall be used, along with the BSCALE keyword,
when the array pixel values are not the true physical values, to transform the
primary array values to the true values. The value field shall contain a
floating point number representing the physical value corresponding to an array
value of zero. The transformation equation is as follows:
 
                 physical value = BZERO + BSCALE x array value
 
 
BUNIT  Keyword     The value field shall contain a character string, describing
the ultimate physical units in which the quantities of the array are expressed.
 
 
BLANK  Keyword     This keyword shall be used only in headers with positive
values of BITPIX (i.e. in arrays with integer data). Columns 1-8 contain the
string, "BLANK~~~" (blanks in columns 6-8). The value field shall contain an
integer that specifies the representation of array members whose data values
are undefined.
 
 
CTYPEn Keywords    The value field shall contain a character string, giving the
physical coordinate represented by axis n.
 
CRPIXn  Keywords   The value field shall contain a floating point number,
identifying the location of a reference point along axis n, in units of the
axis index. The reference point need not coincide with the center of a pixel
(i.e. need not be an integer), nor lie within the actual data array.
 
CRVALn  Keywords   The value field shall contain a floating point number,
giving the value of the coordinate specified by the CTYPEn keyword at the
reference pixel CRPIXn.

22_________________________________________________________SECTION_5.___HEADERS
 
 
CDELTn  Keywords   The value field shall contain a floating point number,
giving the partial derivative of the coordinate specified by the CTYPEn
keywords with respect to the pixel index, evaluated at the reference pixel,
CRPIXn, in units of the coordinate specified by the CTYPEn keyword.
 
CROTAn  Keywords   This keyword is used to indicate a rotation from a standard
coordinate system described by the CTYPEn to a different coordinate system in
which the values in the array are actually expressed. Rules for such rotations
are not further specified in this standard; the rotation should be explained in
comments. The value field shall contain a floating point number, giving the
rotation angle in degrees between axis n and the direction implied by the
coordinate system defined by CTYPEn.
 
 
DATAMAX  Keyword   The value field shall always contain a floating point
number, regardless of the value of BITPIX. This number shall give the maximum
valid physical value represented in the array.
 
 
DATAMIN  Keyword   The value field shall always contain a floating point
number, regardless of the value of BITPIX. This number shall give the minimum
valid physical value represented in the array.
 
 
5.2.2.6       Extension Keywords
 
These keywords are used to describe an extension.
 
 
EXTNAME  Keyword   The value field shall contain a character string, to be used
to distinguish among different extensions with the same value of XTENSION in a
FITS data set.
 
 
EXTVER  Keyword    The value field shall contain an integer, to be used to
distinguish among different extensions in a FITS data set with the same values
for XTENSION and EXTNAME. The values need not start with 1 for the first
extension with a particular value of EXTNAME and need not be in sequence for
subsequent values. If the EXTVER keyword is absent, the data set should be
treated as if the value were 1.
 
EXTLEVEL Keyword   The value field shall contain an integer, specifying the
level in a hierarchy of extension levels of the extension header containing it.
The value shall be 1 for the highest level; levels with a higher value of this
keyword shall be subordinate to levels with a lower value. If the EXTLEVEL
keyword is absent, the data set should be treated as if the value were 1.

5.2.2.7       ASCII Tables Keywords
 
In addition to the mandatory keywords defined in section 5.2.1, these keywords
may be used to describe the structure of an ASCII Tables data array. They are
optional, but if they appear within an ASCII tables extension header, they must
be used as defined in this section of this standard.
 
 
TSCALn Keywords    This keyword shall be used, along with the TZEROn keyword,
when the quantity in field n does not represent a true physical quantity. The
value field shall contain a floating point number representing the coefficient
of the linear term in the linear transformation equation below, which must be
used to compute the true physical value of the field. The default value for
this keyword is 1.0. This keyword may not be used for A-format fields.
 
 
TZEROn Keywords    This keyword shall be used, along with the TSCALn keyword,
when the quantity in field n does not represent a true physical quantity. The
value field shall contain a floating point number representing the zero point
for the true physical value of field n. The default value for this keyword is
0.0. This keyword may not be used for A-format fields.
     The transformation equation used to compute a true physical value from the
quantity in field n is
 
         physical value = TZEROn + TSCALn x field value
 
TNULLn  Keywords   The value field shall contain the character string that
represents an undefined value for field n. The character value should be in the
format given by the TFORMn keyword for field n.
 
TTYPEn  Keywords   The value field shall contain a character string, giving the
name of field n. It is recommended that only upper case letters, digits and
underscore (hexadecimal code 5F) be used in the name. The use of identical
names for different fields should be avoided.
 
TUNITn  Keywords   The value field shall contain a character string describing
the ultimate physical units in which the quantity in field n is expressed.
 
 
5.2.3       Additional  Keywords

5.2.3.2       Restrictions
 
No keyword in the primary header shall specify the presence of a specific
extension in a FITS file; only the EXTEND keyword described in Section 5.2.1.2
shall be used to indicate the possible presence of extensions. No keyword in
either the primary or extension header shall explicitly specify the physical
block size, other than the BLOCKED keyword of Section 5.2.2.1
 
5.3        Value/Comment
 
The structure of the value field shall be determined by the type of the
variable.
 
5.3.1       Character  String
 
If the value is a character string, column 11 shall contain a single quote
(hexadecimal code 27, "'"); the string shall follow, starting in column 12,
followed by a closing single quote (also hexadecimal code 27) that should not
occur before column 20 and must occur in or before column 80. Proper
interpretation of the data set should not require decoding any more than the
first eight characters of a character string. The Character string can only be
composed of the printable ASCII characters (hexadecimal codes 20 through 7E).
 
 
5.3.2       Logical  Variable
 
If the value is a logical constant it shall appear as a T or F in column 30.

6.3        IEEE-754  Floating  Point
 
 
Transmission of 32- and 64-bit floating point data within the FITS format will
use the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard [9]. BITPIX = -32 and BITPIX = -64 signify 32-
and 64-bit IEEE floating point numbers; the absolute value of BITPIX is used
for computing the sizes of data structures. The full IEEE set of number forms
is allowed for FITS interchange, including all special values (e.g., the
"Not-a-Number" cases). The order of the bytes will be sign and exponent first,
followed by the mantissa bytes in order of decreasing significance. The BLANK
keyword should not be used when BITPIX = -32 or -64.
 
 
6.3.1       Thirty-two-bit  Floating  Point
 
 
6.3.1.1       Interpretation
 
 
Lowest numbered (leftmost) bits are most significant. The IEEE NaN

Section   7
 
 
Data   Records
 
 
7.1        Primary  Array
 
 
The data values shall be stored as a byte stream, with no embedded fill or
blank space. The first value shall be stored in the first position of the first
array record. The first value of each subsequent row of the array shall be
stored in the position immediately following the last value of the previous
row, i.e., the data values are stored as a byte stream, with no embedded fill
or blank space. A primary array, when present, shall consist of an array of 1
to 999 dimensions. Arrays of more than one dimension shall be stored in a
sequence such that the index along axis 1 varies most rapidly, that along axis
2 next most rapidly, and those along subsequent axes progressively less
rapidly, with that along axis n varying least rapidly; i. e., the elements of
an array A(x1 ; x2 ; . . .; xm ) shall be in the order shown in Figure 7.1,
where m is the value of NAXIS. The remainder of the last data record, following
the last element of the array shall be filled as prescribed in Section 4.3.2.
 
 
7.2        ASCII  Tables  Extension
 
 
Data shall appear as an ASCII Tables extension if the primary header of the
FITS file has the keyword EXTEND set to T and the first keyword of that
extension header has XTENSION=~'TABLE~~~'.
 
 
7.2.1       Storage
 
 
The data shall be stored as a two-dimensional character array. The row length
and the number of rows shall be specified by keywords in the associated header
records. The number of characters in a row and the number of rows in the table
shall determine the size of the character array. Every row in the array shall
have the same number of characters. The first character of the first row shall
be at the start of the record immediately following the last header record.
The first character of subsequent rows shall follow immediately the character
at the end of the previous row, independent of the record structure. The
positions in the last data record after the last character of the last row of
the data array shall be filled with ASCII blanks.

Each row in the array shall consist of a sequence of fields, with one entry in
each field. For every field, the format of the stored information, location in
the row of the beginning of the field and (optionally) the field name, shall be
specified in keywords of the associated header records. A separate format
keyword must be provided for each field. The location and format of fields
shall be the same for every row.
 
 
7.2.3       Entries
 
 
All data in an ASCII tables extension record shall be 7-bit printable ASCII
characters with the eighth (parity) bit set to zero (hexadecimal codes 20
through 7E). The only possible formats shall be FORTRAN I, A, F, E, or D. If
values of -0 and +0 must be distinguished, then the sign character should be
stored in a separate field in character format. TNULL keywords may be used to
specify a character string that represents an undefined value in each field.
The characters representing an undefined value may differ from field to field
but must be the same within a field.

Appendix   A
 
 
Random   Groups   Structure
 
 
(This Appendix is a part of the NSDSSO FITS Standard)
     Although it is part of the FITS standard, the random groups structure for
the primary data has been used almost exclusively for applications in radio
interferometry; outside this field, few FITS readers can read data in random
groups format. The evolving binary tables format will eventually be able to
accommodate the structure described by random groups. While existing FITS data
sets use the format, and it is therefore included in this standard, its use for
future applications is deprecated by this document.
 
 
A.1         Keywords

A.1.2.1        PTYPEn Keywords
 
 
The value field shall contain a character string, describing the physical
quantity or coordinate represented by the value for parameter n, as derived
from the quantity stored in the FITS data set and the PSCALn and PZEROn
keywords. If the PTYPEn keywords for more than one value of n have the same
associated value, then the data value for the physical quantity or coordinate
so defined is to be obtained by adding the derived data values of the
corresponding parameters.
 
 
A.1.2.2        PSCALn Keywords
 
 
This keyword shall be used, along with the PZEROn keyword, when the data set
parameter values are not the true physical values, to transform the data set
parameter values to the true physical values they represent, using the linear
transformation equation below with the PZEROn keyword. The value field shall
contain a floating point number representing the coefficient of the linear term
in the scaling equation, the scaling factor between true values and data set
parameter values at zero offset.
 
 
A.1.2.3 PZEROn Keywords
 
 
This keyword shall be used, along with the PSCALn keyword, when the data set
param- eter values are not the true physical values, to transform data set
parameter values to the true values. The value field shall contain a floating

value of zero. The transformation equation is as follows:
 
               physical value = PZEROn + PSCALn x data set value
 
 
A.2         Data  Storage
 
 
Values shall be stored as a series of groups. The number of groups shall be
specified by the GCOUNT keyword in the associated header record. Each group
shall consist of the number of parameters specified by the PCOUNT keyword
followed by an array. The first parameter of the first group shall appear in
the first location of the first data record. The first element of each array
shall immediately follow the last parameter associated with that group. The
first parameter of any subsequent group shall immediately follow the last
member of the array of the previous group. The arrays shall be organized
internally in the same way as an ordinary primary array.
 
 
A.3         Data  Representation
 
 
Permissible data representations are the same as those for an ordinary primary
array. Parameters and members of associated data arrays shall have the same
representation. Should more precision be required for an associated parameter
than for a member of a data array, the parameter shall be divided into two
addends, represented by the same value for the PTYPEn keyword. The value shall
be the sum of the physical values, which may have been obtained from the array
values using the PSCALn and PZEROn keywords.

Appendix   B
 
 
A   Binary   Table   Extension
 
 
(This Appendix is not part of the NSDSSO FITS Standard but is included for
informational purposes only.)
     The new "3D"[1] binary tables format is under consideration by the
regional and international FITS committees. Its present form is expected to be
a subset of the eventual structure that is adopted; some structures and
capabilities remain to be added. It is in use at a number of installations, has
been implemented under AIPS and exchanged between AIPS and MIDAS, but much of
the existing FITS-reading software yet cannot decode the format. Because it is
becoming widely used, and because it illustrates an application of the rules
for conforming extensions, it is described in this Appendix.
 
 
B.1         Identification
 
 
The interim identification of a binary table is indicated if the primary header
of the FITS file has the keyword EXTEND set to T and the first keyword of the
associated extension header has XTENSION= 'A3DTABLE'.
 
 
B.2         Header
 
 
The header of a binary table extension shall conform to the requirements for
FITS headers specified in Section 5.
 
 
B.2.1        Required  Keywords
 
 
The card images in the header of a binary table extension use the following
keywords in the order given in Table B.1.
 
 
 
 
 
_________________________________________________
[1] The term "3D" derives from the capacity to store vectors as fields in
binary tables. Thus, the table effectively has depth.

B.2.2        Reserved  Keywords
 
These keywords are optional but are used in A 3-D Tables extensions only in the
manner defined in this document.
 
 
B.2.2.1       TTYPEn Keyword
 
The value field contains a character string representing the label or heading
for field n.
 
 
B.2.2.2       TUNITn Keywords
 
The value field contains a character string representing the physical units of
the quantities contained in field n.
 
 
B.2.2.3       TNULL Keyword.

B.3         Storage
 
Data are stored as a two dimensional array. The number of bytes in a row and
the number of rows are specified by the NAXIS1 and NAXIS2 keywords in the
associated extension header. Every row in the array must have the same number
of bytes. The number of bytes in a row and the number of rows in the table
determines the size of the array. The first byte of the first row is at the
start of the record immediately following the last header record. The first
byte of every subsequent row immediately follows the last byte of the row
preceding it.
 
 
B.4         Format
 
Each row in a binary table extension array consists of a sequence of fields,
each of which consists of zero or more entries. The location, length and format
of each field are the same for every row. The field sequence is specified by
the TFORMn keywords of the associated header. All entries in a field must be of
the same data type. For each field, the number of entries, data type, and
(optionally) the field name, are specified in keywords of the associated header
records. A separate format keyword must be provided for each field.

Eight-bit integers shall be unsigned binary integers, stored in one byte.
 
 
B.5.5        Sixteen-bit  Integers
 
Sixteen-bit integers shall be twos-complement signed binary integers, contained
in two bytes. The sign bit shall be the leftmost bit of the leftmost byte.
Significance shall decrease from left to right; the least significant bit shall
be the rightmost bit of the rightmost byte. The TNULL keyword is used if needed
to specify the symbol corresponding to an undefined value.
 
 
B.5.6        Thirty-two-bit  Integers
 
Thirty-two bit integers shall be twos-complement signed binary integers,
contained in four bytes. The sign bit shall be the leftmost bit of the leftmost

Appendix   C
 
 
Implementation   on   Physical   Media
 
 
(This Appendix is not part of the NSDSSO FITS Standard, but is included as a
guide to recommended practices)
 
 
C.1         Block  Size
 
 
The block size (physical record length) for transport of data should, where
possible, equal the logical record length or an integer blocking factor times
this record length. Standard values of the blocking factor may be specified for
each medium; if not otherwise specified, the expected value is unity.
 
 
C.1.1        Magnetic  Tape
 
 
For nine-track magnetic tapes conforming to the ANSI X3.40-1983 specifications
[10], there should be from one to 10 logical records per physical block. The
BLOCKED keyword (section 5.2.2.1) may be used to warn that there may be more
than one logical record per physical block. The last physical block of a FITS
file should be truncated to the minimum number of FITS logical records required
to hold the remaining data, in accordance with ANSI X3.27-1978 specifications
[11]. With the issuance of this standard the BLOCKED keyword is deprecated by
this document.
 
 
C.1.2        Other  Media
 
 
For media where the physical block size cannot be equal to or an integral
multiple of the FITS logical record length of 23040-bits (2880 8-bit bytes),
records should be written over multiple blocks. Conventions regarding the
relation between physical block size and logical record length of FITS data
sets have not been otherwise established for other media.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________

48_______________________________APPENDIX_C.___IMPLEMENTATION_ON_PHYSICAL_MEDIA
 
 
C.2         Physical  Properties  of  Media
 
The arrangement of digital bits and other physical properties of any medium
should be in conformance with the ANSI standard for that medium as specified in
the relevant document.
 
 
C.3         Labeling
 
C.3.1       Tape
 
Tapes may be either ANSI standard labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled tapes are
preferred.
 
 
C.3.2       Other  Media
 
Conventions regarding labels for FITS data sets have not been established for
other media.
 
 
C.4         FITS  File  Boundaries
 
C.4.1       Magnetic  Tape
 
Individual FITS files are terminated by a tape-mark.
 
 
C.4.2       Other  Media
 
For media where the physical record size cannot be equal to or an integral
multiple of the standard FITS logical record length, a record of fewer than
23040 bits (2880 8-bit bytes) immediately following the end of the primary
header, data, or an extension should be treated as an end-of-file. Otherwise,
individual FITS data sets should be terminated by a delimiter appropriate to
the medium, analogous to the tape end-of-file mark. If more than one FITS data
set appears on a physical structure, the appropriate end-of-file indicator
should immediately precede the start of the primary headers of all data sets
after the first. FITS data sets should start at the start of a file.
 
 
C.5         Multiple  Physical  Volumes
 
Storage of a single FITS file on more than one tape or on multiple units of any
other medium is not supported.
