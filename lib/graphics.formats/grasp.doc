                                  What is GRASP?

        GRASP is a simple graphics programming pseudo-language which can be
        used to create and run animated graphics demonstrations, tutorials,
        and  presentations  on  an  IBM  PC/XT/AT or respective compatible.
        GRASP requires that the user make use of  some other  tool, such as
        Mouse Systems'  PCPAINT PLUS, to create PCPAINT PLUS packed page or
        BSAVE format pictures, or 'capture' screens from any other graphics
        software with  the provided  capture utility  program. This product
        was developed by the folks at  Microtex Industries,  the authors of
        PCPAINT PLUS, so it is patterned to take advantage of the pictures,
        clippings and fonts  created  with  PCPAINT  PLUS  and  its related
        utilities, like FONTASIA and ARTOOLS.

        GRASP was  designed to  be the  base for many other products. GRASP
        files can be generated by programs  written in  virtually any other
        language. This  allows great flexibility to users in many different
        areas. It is  this  flexibility  that  sets  GRASP  apart  from its
        competitors. GRASP  in its  raw form,  as you  have it here, is not
        indended to be a  user-friendly,  end-user  tool.  It  is, however,
        simple enough  that any  user can  quickly learn  how to manipulate
        GRASP files with ease.


        Features:

        * Supports IBM CGA, IBM EGA, HERCULES, AST ColorGraphPlus,
          Plantronics, AST Preview, 3 text modes.

        * 16 Picture Buffers

        * 128 Clipping Buffers

                            What is on the GRASP disk?


        The following files are on the GRASP disk

        GRASP.EXE -

        This is the main GRASP program.  This   version  of GRASP  gets the
        pictures, character  sets, clippings  and text  files it needs from
        the current directory on your current disk drive,  unless otherwise
        specified in  the text  files. This  program allows  you to create,
        edit and execute your GRASP programs.

        GRASPRT.EXE - 

        This is the run-time version of GRASP. This  version of  GRASP gets

                      Making a working copy of the GRASP disk


        The GRASP disk is not copy protected in any way. You should back up
        the disk  using the DOS diskcopy command, or you may perform a file
        by file backup to a hard disk using the DOS copy command. There are
        several different  ways to  copy disks under DOS, but the following
        will  work  on  almost  any  hardware  configuration  since  all it
        requires is access to the DOS master disk and 1 floppy disk drive.

        For PCs with 1 or 2 floppys, or an XT or AT with 1 floppy:

        Put your  DOS master  disk in  drive A  and turn  on the machine or
        press CTRL-ALT-DEL to re-boot the system.  Enter the  Date and Time
        when prompted and you should see the system prompt:

        A>_

        Type:

        A>DISKCOPY A: A:

        and press  the return  key. You  will be prompted to put the SOURCE
        disk in drive A. Remove the DOS master disk from  drive A,  put the
        GRASP distribution  disk in,  close the  door and  press the return
        key. After it reads some information, DOS will  ask you  to put the
        TARGET disk in drive A. Put a blank disk (formatted or unformatted)
        into drive A, close the door and press return. If  your machine has
        less than  512K of memory, you may be prompted to perform this disk
        exchange several times. When the process is complete, put the GRASP
        disk away in a safe place and use the backup copy for your work.

                                 Installing GRASP


        Simple Set-Up
        -------------

        To  develop  demos  under  the  grasp  system, you need to have the
        following GRASP files and programs accessible:

        GRASP.EXE
        CM1.HLP
        CM2.HLP
        ED1.HLP
        FD1.HLP
        FD2.HLP
        RP1.HLP

        as well as your pictures, clippings and fonts.

        With all of these files in  one subdirectory,  you will  be able to
        create and  edit your  demo program and have access to the help. If
        you do not need the help files, you may omit them. If you are going
        to be  creating a  library version of your demo, you will also need
        access to the librarian utility, GLIB.EXE. 



        Advanced Set-Up
        ---------------

        The following is an example of a well set-up system on a hard disk,
        including PCPAINT,  so that you can edit pictures and clippings and
        create your demo with a minimum of effort.

        From the root directory, create a sub-directory called PAINTLIB and
        put all  the PCPAINT  files in  it. (This is the recommended method
        for installing PCPAINT). In addition, be  sure your  PATH statement
        points to  PAINTLIB and  set up an environment variable to point to
        PAINTLIB as well with the command:

        SET PAINTLIB=C:\PAINTLIB

        Also make a sub-directory off the root called GRASP. Copy the GRASP
        disk contents  to the  sub-directory GRASP. Add the GRASP directory
        to your PATH command. Then create a DEMO  directory, change  to it,
        and run  GRASP by  typing GRASP at the command prompt. When you are
        in the GRASP editor, you can  run PCPAINT  by pressing  ALT-F10 and
        your previous  PATH and  SET statements will help DOS know where to
        find it. The following diagram is an example:

                            GRASP Installation Diagram


        This diagram  shows the  proper structure  for your sub-directories
        for GRASP  to perform  in the  above stated  manner. This  is not a
        requirement, just an example.
                                       
                                   ___________
                                  |           |
                                  |  C:\Root  |
                                  |___________|
                ________________________|________________________ . . . .
         ______|_______    ______|______    __________|__________    
        |              |  |             |  |                     |
        |   PAINTLIB   |  |    GRASP    |  |    DOS or OTHER     |
        |______________|  |_____________|  |_____________________|   
            :                  :      |          : 
        PCPAINT.EXE        GRASP.EXE  |      DOS files
        PxPAINT.OVR        ED1.HLP    |      Various batch files 
        CAP.COM            CM1.HLP    |
                           CM2.HLP    | 
                           CM3.HLP    |
                           FD1.HLP    |
                           FD2.HLP    |
                           RP1.HLP    |
                                      |
                           ___________|_ 
                          |             | 
                          |    Demos    |
                          |_____________|

        Then these statements would be in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        SET PAINTLIB=C:\PAINTLIB
        PATH C:\PAINTLIB;C:\GRASP;C:\whateverelseyouwant...

        With this  set-up, you  can be  in any  directory and  run GRASP by
        typing GRASP and PCPAINT by typing PCPAINT. You have full access to
        all help files and the  PCPAINT  system.  The  auto-run  feature in
        GRASP (ALT-F10)  allows you to run PCPAINT while in GRASP. It looks
        for PCPAINT in the \PAINTLIB directory.  The  GRASP help  files are
        only accessible if they are in one of three places:

        1) In the current directory
        2) In the directory pointed to by the environment string 'PAINTLIB'
        3) In a sub-directory off the root called 'GRASP'

        GRASP performs  a search  for the help files in this order. If they
        are not found, a message  will  appear  when  you  first  run grasp
        telling you so. You may run GRASP without access to the help files,
        but you will get a beep if you try to access them.

        To use GRASP you need to do 3 things.


        1) Create the pictures and clippings you want  to use  with PCPAINT
        PLUS, or capture them the the CAP utility.

        2) Use the built-in GRASP editor to create an GRASP 'program' which
        is nothing more than a list of GRASP commands and some comments.

        3) Run your demonstration  by pressing  F10 from  the editor  or by
        selecting EXECUTE FILE from the main GRASP menu.


        It's that  simple. If you want to give your demo away, you must put
        the .PIC, .CLP, .SET and .TXT  files into  a library  with the GLIB
        utility, and distribute the library file with GRASPRT.EXE.

                                   Running GRASP

        To run the GRASP, enter at the command prompt:

        A:>GRASP

        You will be presented with a screen that looks something like this:

                                    Edit File      
                                    Execute File   
                                    Load File      
                                    Save File      
                                    Quit GRASP     

                               Current File: TMPFILE

        To select  an option from this menu, use the up and down arrow keys
        until the option you want to select is highlighted. Then just press
        return  and  the  option  is  selected. Each of these options has a
        special meaning to GRASP.

        Edit File: The Edit File option tells GRASP that you want to  go to
        the editor and create or modify your GRASP program file.

        Execute File:  The Execute  File option  tells GRASP to execute the
        currently loaded GRASP program file.

        Load File: The Load File option allows you to tell GRASP to load in
        an existing  file, or  to create  a new one. Notice that just below
        the menu there is an area  with the  current filename  listed. When
        you  first  run  GRASP,  the  system  will  default to a file named
        TMPFILE. This is the name that GRASP will use unless  you specify a
        new one.  To specify  a new one, just type in the name you want. DO
        NOT specify  the filename  extension. GRASP  will automatically use
        the extension  .TXT for you. To create a new file, just perform the
        load as though the  file you  want already  exists. GRASP  is smart
        enough to  understand and  create a  new file for you. If a file is
        already loaded, and changes have been  made, GRASP  will prompt you
        for saving before allowing you to load another. This keeps you from
        trashing your current file.

        Save File: The Save File option tells GRASP that you want to save
        the current working GRASP program file. It works  much the  same as
        the load  command. Just  specify the name you want to save the file
        under and press return. The  system  will  default  to  the current
        working name.

        Quit GRASP: The Quit GRASP option tells the system that you want to
        exit GRASP. If a file is loaded and has been changed since the last
        save, GRASP will prompt you for saving before allowing you to quit.

        Be sure to save your file before quitting!


        Of these  options, the only one that requires special consideration
        is the first one, Edit File. Select that  option and  let's explore
        the world of the GRASP editor...

                                 The Grasp Editor


        If you  have selected  the Edit File option from the main menu, you
        will now be in the GRASP editor. The screen should have a blue line
        across the top that looks like the following:


        TMPFILE         COL:1     LINE:1     POS:0     LEN:0      INSERT ON

        These are  just information  items about  the current  file you are
        working on and the mode you are operating in. Starting  at the left
        is the  name of  the current  file, which defaults to TMPFILE. Next
        comes the current cursor column  number,  the  current  cursor line
        number,  the  current  cursor's  character position relative to the
        entire file, and the total  number  of  characters  in  the current
        file.  At  the  far  right  is  the  status  of the INS key on your
        keyboard. If INSERT mode is ON,  then characters  you type  will be
        inserted before  the character  just to the right of the cursor. If
        INSERT mode is OFF, then characters to the right of the cursor will
        be overwritten.  This second  mode, INSERT  OFF, is commonly called
        OVERSTRIKE mode. This information is just there for  reference, and
        with the  exception of  the INSERT  mode signal, you probably won't
        need to refer to it too often.

        The first three function keys are the most important keys  to learn
        in  the  GRASP  editor.  GRASP  provides  'Quick  Help'  for  three
        different areas and is accessable by pressing F1, F2 or F3. 

        NOTE: If you press one of these function keys and  hear a  low tone
        from  your  computer  and  no  help  appears,  it  means that GRASP
        couldn't find the .HLP files that  were on  your distribution disk.
        If you  want to use the help. the .HLP files must be on the current
        drive and directory, in a directory called 'GRASP' directly off the
        root directory,  or in  a directory  pointed to  by the environment
        string 'PAINTLIB'. See INSTALLING GRASP for more details.

        F1 - Provides help in using the GRASP Editor. This  includes a list
        of the  most commonly  used editing  keys and a description of what
        each function key is used for.

        F2 - Provides  a  quick  summary  listing  of  all  available GRASP
        commands.  This  information  is  not  a  complete reference on the
        commands of GRASP, but  rather a  command syntax  reference so that
        you  can   insure  proper  useage  of  the  commands  and  a  brief
        description of what the command is used for. 

        F3 - Provides a  summary listing  of the  25 GRASP  fades and their
        respective  numbers.  Remember  that  all  fades  can  be  used for
        graphics  pictures,  text  pictures,  pictures  in   a  window  and
        clippings.

        If this  is your  first time  running GRASP and you are too lazy or
        too bored  to  read  the  entire  manual,  you  should  find enough
        information in these help keys to get you started.

        If you want to learn a little more about the editor, here is a full
        description of all the keys available in the GRASP editor.

        F1  - Quick help with the editor.
        F2  - Quick help with the commands.
        F3  - Quick help with the fades and video modes.
        F4  - Start/End highlighting a block.
        F5  - Copy a highlighted block.
        F6  - Move a highlighted block.
        F7  - Read a block in from disk.
        F8  - Write a highlighted block to disk.
        F9  - Save current file and run from current line.
        F10 - Save current file and run from the top.

        ALT/F1   - Quick exit to DOS. Typing EXIT at the DOS propmt returns
                   you to the GRASP editor.

        ALT/F10  - Run  PCPAINT  from  within the GRASP editor. PCPAINT.EXE
                   and  its  overlays  must  be  in  a  subdirectory called
                   PAINTLIB off the root directory on the current drive.

        CTRL-K-X or
        ESC      - Quit the  editor. Do  not save file. Leave flag set that
                   indicates changes if they have been made. 

        CTRL-K-Q - Quit  the  editor.  Do  not  save  file.  Reset  flag to
                   indicate no changes have been made.

        CTRL-K-D or
        ALT/X    - Quit the editor, save file if changes have been made.

        CTRL-K-S or
        ALT/S or
        ALT/W    - Save the current file and continue editing.

        ALT/L or
        ALT/R    - Reload   the   current   file   and   continue  editing,
                   overwriting any changes made.

        CTRL-Y or
        ALT/D    - Delete current line.

        CTRL-N   - Insert a carriage return  and  leave  cursor  at current
                   line.

        CTRL-K-B - Mark block beginnng. Same as the first time you hit F4.

        CTRL-Q-D or
        END      - Go to end of line.

        INS      - Turns insert mode on and off.

        DEL      - Deletes character under cursor and adjusts text.

        ARROW  KEYS  /  PGUP  / PGDN and Wordstar(tm) 'Diamond' equivalents
        move cursor around document.

        Now that you know how to use the editor, let's  see exactly  how to
        make a demo...

                               Simple GRASP Tutorial

        Loading and displaying a picture:

        It  is  important  to  understand  that  GRASP  is very much a LINE
        oriented programming pseudo-language.  It  is  called  this because
        inter-line  dependencies  have  been  kept to a minimum. In simpler
        terms, GRASP interprets one line at a time, executes it,  then goes
        and  gets  the  next  line.  Except  for  a few special cases, what
        happens on each line is relatively independent of the previous line
        or the next line. This is important because if you understand this,
        then creating a GRASP  program  will  be  easier  to  understand in
        concept.

        Each line can start with only one of three things:

        1) A GRASP command. (PRESS F2 to see all the GRASP commands)

        2) A semicolon - ';'. This indicates the beginning of a comment.

        3) A  label. This  can be any continuous string of ASCII characters
        with the exception of space, and must be followed by a colon - ':'.

        This keeps  the GRASP  interpreter's job  simple. It  either sees a
        command,  and  immediately  looks  for  possible  parameters,  or a
        semicolon, in which case  it ignores  the rest  of that  line, or a
        label, which it puts into a list so it can find it later if needed.
        Any  variation  from  these  three  options  will  result  in GRASP
        thinking that what you typed was  a GRASP  command which  it cannot
        understand, and results in an 'INVALID COMMAND IN LINE XXX' message
        when you try to execute the program.

        Usually, you will want to start you GRASP  program with  a comment,
        like a title of your program or your name, etc. Type:

        ; DEMO Program for GRASP

        and press return. You now have written a 1-line GRASP program. 

        Exciting huh? I'll bet you can't wait for more.

        The very  first command  in every  GRASP program  should be a VIDEO
        command which tells GRASP which video mode you want to  use. If you
        select a  video mode  that is not available on your computer, GRASP
        will try to understand and tell you so.  If you  get wierd results,
        or  the  screen  seems  to  go  crazy,  don't worry, just check the
        reference section of this manual to be sure  you are  using a valid
        video mode.  For this  tutorial, we  will assume that your computer
        has an IBM Color Graphics Adapter  or compatible,  and we  will use
        the standard 4 color 320x200 mode, which GRASP understands as video
        mode A. Type the  following (exactly  as spelled  below, with upper
        case):

                   GRASP - Graphical System for Presentation
                                   Page:  15







        ; DEMO Program for GRASP
        ;
        video Q

        Now press F10 to execute the program. (By the way, all this does is
        set the video mode and come  back to  the editor.  Not too exciting
        yet, but we're getting there...)

        You should get a message that says

                           Illegal argument(s) at line 3
                                 File TMPFILE.TXT
                             Press any Key to Continue

        Any time you see the message, it means that the command you entered
        was correct, but one of the arguments you entered was incorrect.
        Press a key and you will  be returned  back to  the editor,  to the
        line where  the error  occured. The  problem here  is that  Q is an
        invalid video mode. Change it to A (which stands for  CGA 320x200 4
        color mode)  and press  F10 again. Your screen should blink and the
        you will be put back in the editor.  

        Now we have named the program and set up a video mode, so it's time
        to try  out some  graphics commands.  On the distribution disk is a
        picture named  GRASP.PIC.  This  is  a  4  color  picture  from the
        CGADEMO.GL file.  Let's load  it into  GRASP and display it using a
        variety of fades.

        ; DEMO Program for GRASP
        ;
        video A
        ;
        pload grasp,1                    ; load picture into buffer #1
        pfade 0,1,0,0                    ; fade it to the screen using fade
                                         ;  #0
        waitkey                           ; wait for a keypress before     
                                         ;  returning to the editor.

        now, press F10 and you should see the GRASP.PIC picture  loaded and
        displayed. 

        Change  the  first  parameter  of  the  pfade command to any number
        between 0 and 25 and watch all the different special  effects. Then
        to slow  things down, try a number like 50 for the third parameter,
        which is the speed of the fade. Speed  seems to  have no  effect on
        some fades,  while on others, it makes a lot of difference. This is
        because of the nature of  each  individual  fade.  To  optimize the
        performance of GRASP, it was decided that speed would be a relative
        number, that is, relative to the actual fade.  This way,  each fade
        may be accurately controlled from its fastest speed to its slowest.

                                   Page:  16






        Let's do one more command, the  WINDOW command.  Window means don't
        allow  any  part  of  the  picture  that lies outside of a specific
        rectangle to be faded to the screen. Add the window command to your
        demo program as follows:

        ; DEMO Program for GRASP
        ;
        video A
        ;
        pload grasp,1                    ; load picture into buffer #1
        window 0,0,100,100               ; set fade clip window
        pfade 0,1,0,0                    ; fade it to the screen using fade
                                         ;  #0
        waitkey                          ; wait for a keypress before
                                         ;  returning to the editor.

        now press F10 and watch the  difference. You  should see  that only
        the lower  left part  of your picture was actually dissolved to the
        screen. Change the coordinates of the window command  and watch the
        results.

        One  other  note:  The  window  command  can  only  operate on byte
        boundaries. For most video modes, this means every 8 pixels  in the
        x  direction.   You  don't   have  to  worry  because  WINDOW  will
        automatically adjust itself to a byte boundary.
          
        This concludes this lesson.  Other  commands  in  GRASP  work  in a
        similar fashion.  Experiment with them. Just remember to keep track
        of your video modes and buffers.  You may  also want  to take apart
        the demo program, CGADEMO.GL using the GLIB.EXE utility and look at
        the code for more examples.

                    Running the library file version - GRASPRT


        The Library file, or runtime version of the program is identical to
        the  text  file  version  except  that  the  interpreter  gets  its
        information from  a library  file instead  of the  current disk and
        directory. The  GLIB utility  will put all of your .PIC, .CLP, .SET
        and .TXT files into a library  with the  extension GL.  To run your
        demo execute the command:

        GRASPRT <libfile> <textfile>

        If  the  textfile  is  omitted  from  the  command line, GRASP will
        execute the first text file it finds in the library.

        To run the demo that comes with GRASP, type:

        GRASPRT CGADEMO

                     Using the GRASP Graphics Librarian - GLIB

        The Graphics LIBrarian, GLIB.EXE, is used in the following manner:

        GLIB [-dstuea] libname [files...]  

        where the following commands are supported:

         -d   delete file from library
         -s   extended file list
         -t   quick file list
         -u   update (add) file to library
         -e   extract file from library
         -a   extract all files from library

        For example, if you  wanted to  put all  of the  .PIC files  in the
        current directory into a library file named MYFILE, you would type:

        GLIB -u MYFILE *.PIC

        Or if you wanted to extract GRASP.PIC from the library CGADEMO, you
        would type:

        GLIB -e CGADEMO GRASP.PIC

        Be  sure that all files  needed for  your demo  are in  the library
        file  before  you  try  to  run  it.  Otherwise,  you may get error
        messages.

        NOTE:
        You cannot use  wild  cards  for  extracting  or  deleting  in this
        version (1.0)  of GLIB.  However, you may use wild cards for adding
        to or updating the library.

        More Examples:

        GLIB -d DEMO FRED.TXT

        will delete the file 'fred.txt' from library file DEMO.GL

        GLIB -e DEMO LOGO.CLP

        will extract the clipping 'logo.clp' from library file DEMO.GL

        GLIB -u DEMO MTX.CLP

        will add/replace the picture 'mtx.pic' to library file DEMO.GL

        BOX                                                            BOX


        Summary:
        -------

        BOX allows you to draw a box on the screen  in the  current drawing
        color.


        Syntax:
        ------

        BOX startx, starty, endx, endy, <width>

        where 'startx'  and 'starty'  is the point of one corner of the box
        and 'endx' and endy'  is the  point of  the opposite  corner of the
        box. Width  is the  number of  pixels wide  you want the box to be.
        Width is drawn 'inward' from the original box. 


        Example:
        -------

        BOX 0,0,100,100

        will draw a box in the  current  drawing  color  from  x=0,  y=0 to
        x=100, y=100.


        Comments:
        --------

        Transparent mode  does not affect this command. Default width is 1.
        BOX is not available in text modes.

        CFADE                                                        CFADE


        Summary:
        -------

        CFADE allows you to dissolve or fade a clipping to  the screen. You
        may specify  one of several dissolves, the speed for that dissolve,
        and a delay after the dissolve. This command  is similar  to PFADE,
        but applies  to clippings. The same 25 fades that apply to pictures
        also apply to clippings.


        Syntax:
        ------

        CFADE fade number, x, y, <buffer number>, <speed>, <delay>

        where 'fade  number' is  the number  of the  fade you  want to use,
        'buffer number'  is the  clipping buffer  number where the clipping
        you want to fade has been loaded, 'x' and 'y' are the  location for
        the clipping  to be  faded, 'speed'  is the  speed of  the fade and
        'delay' is the time to wait after the  delay. Speed  can be  in the
        range 0-10000. Check Appendix B for a list of fades.


        Example:
        -------

        CFADE 2,20,40,5,500,1000

        will fade  the clipping  in buffer 5 using fade 2 at location x=24,
        y=40 at speed 500, and then  wait 10  seconds. The  delay works the
        same as using the WAITKEY command. 


        Comments:
        --------

        Note: CFADE only fades byte-width clippings and puts them up at the
        nearest byte boundary to the x  and  y  specified  in  the command.
        Deviations may cause unpredictable results. Use the utility WHATCLP
        to obtain the needed  information  about  your  clippings.  If your
        clipping  is  not  byte-width,  it  will  fill  the  right  edge to
        byte-width with white (highest  color available).  Transparent mode
        does NOT apply to CFADE. 

        Default values for optional parameters:

        buffer number: 1
        speed:         0
        delay:         0

        CFREE                                                        CFREE


        Summary:
        -------

        CFREE is  used to free-up a clipping buffer. Sometimes, you may run
        out of memory and need to clear up  some buffers  you have  full of
        clippings you have already used.


        Syntax:
        ------

        CFREE buf1, <buf2>, <buf3>...

        where 'buf1' and other buffers are buffers you want to free-up.


        Example:
        -------

        CFREE 1,4,12

        will free-up clipping buffers 1, 4 and 12.

        CFREE 1,-,16

        will free-up buffers 1 through 16. You MUST use commas or spaces to
        separate these parameters.


        Comments:
        --------

        This is especially useful in  EGA  16  color  mode  where  space is
        critical.

        CHGCOLOR                                                  CHGCOLOR


        Summary:
        -------

        Chgcolor is  used to  set the color palette registers in IBM EGA 16
        color mode. On the  EGA, there  are 16  possible colors,  called an
        'index', and  each of  these color  indices may  be one of 64 color
        'values'.


        Syntax:
        ------

        CHGCOLOR color index, color value,...

        where 'color index' refers to the color number  you want  to change
        in the range 0-15 and 'color value' lies in the range 0-63.


        Example:
        -------

        CHGCOLOR 3,32

        will change color index 3 to color value 32.


        Comments:
        --------

        Remember, this only works in EGA 16 color modes.

        CIRCLE                                                      CIRCLE


        Summary:
        -------

        CIRCLE allows  you to draw a circle or ellipse on the screen in the
        current drawing color. The  color parameters  must be  specified in
        pairs, as in the example.


        Syntax:
        ------

        CIRCLE centerx, centery, xradius, <yradius>

        where 'centerx'  and 'centery' is the center point of the circle or
        ellipse, xradius' is the radius in the x-direction and 'yradius' is
        the radius in the y direction.


        Example:
        -------

        CIRCLE 100,100,100,20

        will draw a circle centered at x=100, y=100 with x radius=100 and y
        radius=20.


        Comments:
        --------

        Transparent mode does not affect this command. Failure to specify a
        yradius assumes yradius=xradius and a circle is produced. Note also
        that circle  here implies  xradius=yradius which,  depending on the
        aspect  ratio  of  your  current  video  mode, may not be a circle.
        CIRCLE is not available in text modes.

        CLEARSCR                                                  CLEARSCR


        Summary:
        -------

        Clearscr is used to clear the screen to the current drawing color.


        Syntax:
        ------

        CLEARSCR


        Example:
        -------

        CLEARSCR

        will clear the screen to the current drawing  color (the  color set
        with the last COLOR command).

        CLOAD                                                        CLOAD


        Summary:
        -------

        This command  is used  to load  a clipping into a buffer. There are
        128 buffers available for  clippings in  GRASP. It  is advised, for
        memory  reasons,  that  the  user  try  to  manage  using as few as
        possible. A clipping must be loaded into a buffer before  it can be
        dissolved or put up onto the screen.


        Syntax:
        ------

        CLOAD clipping, buffer number, <shiftparm>

        where 'clipping'  is the name of the clipping you want to load (the
        file name extension is optional) and 'buffer number'  is the number
        of the  buffer you  want to  load in to. Valid buffer numbers are 1
        through 128. Buffer 0 is non-existent  for clippings,  and thus, no
        clipping may  be loaded  into it.  'Shiftparm' indicates whether or
        not to create the  shifted copies  necessary to  place clippings at
        non-byte boundaries. Default for shiftparm is 0 or YES. Placing a 1
        here will cause GRASP  not to  create the  shifted copies  and thus
        saving memory.  This is useful if you know that you are going to be
        using CFADE on this clipping and therefore couldn't use the shifted
        copies anyway.


        Example:
        -------

        CLOAD myclip,5

        will load the clipping myclip.clp into clipping buffer number 5.


        Comments:
        --------

        If you  do not understand the concept of shifted copies, it is best
        not to fool around with the shiftparm parameter.  Note also  that a
        file extension  is not  necessary in  your GRASP file. Drive letter
        and path may be specified.

        COLOR                                                        COLOR


        Summary:
        -------

        COLOR allows you to choose a drawing color.  Drawing color  is used
        for  drawing  primitives  (such  as  line,  box, circle, or point),
        transparent mode selection, text  strings and  clearing the screen.
        Secondary color is used for background color in text mode or shadow
        color for font styles in graphics modes.


        Syntax:
        ------

        COLOR n1,<n2>

        where 'n1' is the drawing color and 'n2' is the secondary color.


        Example:
        -------

        COLOR 3,0

        will set the current  drawing color  to color  3 and  the secondary
        color to 0.


        Comments:
        --------

        Related  commands  are  LINE,  BOX,  CIRCLE, POINT, TRAN, CLEARSCR,
        PALETTE, MODE and PFADE. The secondary color is used for the bottom
        character in  shadow text strings and the background color for text
        screens. Secondary color defaults to color 0 if not specified.

        Summary:
        -------
        This command allows you to execute another program from within your
        GRASP program.  Useful for utility programs, or custom programs you
        write that provide a function that GRASP does not.


        Syntax:
        ------

        EXEC program, <parameters>

        where 'program' is the name of the program you wish to execute. You
        MUST include  path if  it is  in a  different path, and all program
        names must include the extension. 'Parameters' are any command line
        parameters you would normally pass to the program.


        Example:
        -------

        EXEC \PAINTLIB\PCPAINT.EXE, /O

        will execute  pcpaint from  the \paintlib  directory on the current
        drive passing the /O parameter.


        Comments:
        --------

        You MUST include full path and file extension.

        Summary:
        -------

        This command  allows you  to set the gaps between characters in the
        text command and also the width of the space character.


        Syntax:
        ------

        FGAPS <char gap, space gap>

        where 'char gap is the  number  of  pixels  between  characters and
        'space gap' is the number of pixels wide for the space character.


        Example:
        -------

        FGAPS 3,9

        will  set  the  inter-character  gap  to  3  pixels  and  the space
        character to a width of 9 pixels.


        Comments:
        --------

        Note that this has no effect on the TEXT command if you are in TEXT
        mode. FGAPS  with no parameters resets the gaps to the default gaps
        for the currently loaded font.

        Summary:
        -------

        This command is used to load in a  character set.  The GRASP system
        only allows  1 character set in memory at a time. After a character
        set has been loaded,  TEXT  commands  (see  command  TEXT)  will be
        performed using the currently loaded font. Applies only to graphics
        modes.


        Syntax:
        ------

        FLOAD fontname

        where 'fontname'  is the  name of  the FONTRIX(tm)  or PCPAINT font
        file you wish to load. File name extensions are optional.


        Example:
        -------

        FLOAD bocklin

        will load  the FONTRIX(tm)  font bocklin.set into memory for use by
        the TEXT command.


        Comments:
        --------

        When a font is loaded with FLOAD, the gaps are reset to the default
        gaps  for  that  font.  So  be  sure  to reset gaps using the FGAPS
        command if the default gaps aren't adequate.

        FLOAT                                                        FLOAT


        Summary:
        -------

        FLOAT allows you to  animate  a  clipping  or  series  of clippings
        between any two points on the screen with one command. It
        is similar  to FLY  except that it performs an exchange with screen
        data so that the background may be preserved. 

        Syntax:
        ------

        FLOAT startx, starty, endx,  endy, increment,  delay, clip1, clip2,
        ...clipn

        where 'startx' and 'starty' indicate the starting point, 'endx' and
        'endy' indicate  the  ending  point,  'increment'  is  the distance
        between each  put along  the line, 'delay' is the wait time between
        each put and 'clip1-clipn' is the list of clippings. 


        Example:
        -------

        FLOAT 0,0,200,200,2,10,1,2,3

        will 'FLOAT' the clippings 1,2 and  3   in that  order from  0,0 to
        200,200, skipping  2 pixels between each put, waiting a count of 10
        between each put. For example, clip 1 will  be put  at 0,0,  clip 2
        will be  put at  clip 2,2, clip 3 will be put a 4,4, clip 1 will be
        put at 6,6, clip2 will be put at 8,8, etc.


        Comments:
        --------

        This command differs from FLY in that it  preserves the background.
        Also note  that the  last operation  it performs  is the swap-back,
        which restores screen data. This means that if  you want  to have a
        clipping on  the screen after the FLOAT command, you have to follow
        the FLOAT with a  PUTUP command.  Selective use  of transparent can
        yield very interesting results.

        FLY                                                            FLY


        Summary:
        -------

        FLY allows you to animate a clipping or series of clippings between
        any two points on the screen with one command.


        Syntax:
        ------

        FLY startx, starty, endx,  endy,  increment,  delay,  clip1, clip2,
        ...clipn

        where 'startx' and 'starty' indicate the starting point, 'endx' and
        'endy' indicate  the  ending  point,  'increment'  is  the distance
        between each  put along  the line, 'delay' is the wait time between
        each put and  'clip1-clipn'  is  the  list  of  clippings.  You may
        animate up to 10 clippings.


        Example:
        -------

        FLY 0,0,200,200,2,10,1,2,3

        will  'fly'  the  clippings  1,2  and  3  in that order from 0,0 to
        200,200, skipping 2 pixels between each put, waiting a count  of 10
        between each  put. For  example, clip  1 will be put at 0,0, clip 2
        will be put at clip 2,2, clip 3 will be put a  4,4, clip  1 will be
        put at 6,6, clip2 will be put at 8,8, etc.


        Comments:
        --------
         
        Selective use  of slightly larger than necessary clippings (to wipe
        out  the    previous  put)  and  transparent  mode  can  yield very
        interesting results.

        Summary:
        -------

        This command allows you to choose a style for the characters in the
        TEXT command. Styles are as follows:

        style #    style
        -------    -----
           0       Default, normal letters
           1       Bold up.
           2       Bold right.
           3       Shadow up right.
           4       Shadow up left.
           5       Shadow up right 2 pixels.
           6       Shadow up left 2 pixels.


        Syntax:
        ------

        FSTYLE fstyle

        where fstyle is the number of the desired style.


        Example:
        -------

        FSTYLE 4

        will set the text style to shadow up left.


        Comments:
        --------
        Use of the command with no parameters will default to style 0.

        GOSUB                                                        GOSUB


        Summary:
        -------

        This command allows the transfer of  control during  execution of a
        GRASP program  to a  sub-program defined  elsewhere in the program.
        This is similar to a BASIC gosub command. The subprogram is defined
        by a  label at the beginning, and a RETURN command at the end. When
        the  RETURN  is  encountered,  control  is  returned  to  the  line
        following the line where the GOSUB ocurred.


        Syntax:
        ------

        GOSUB subroutine

        where 'subroutine'  is a sub-program defined elsewhere in the GRASP
        program.


        Example:
        -------

        GOSUB myprog

        will transfer control to  the  sub-program  'myprog'.  Control will
        return when the statement RETURN in encountered in the sub-program.


        Comments:
        --------

        Also see command RETURN.

        Summary:
        -------

        This command  allows you  to transfer control of a GRASP program to
        another portion of the program,  similar  to  the  same  command in
        BASIC. You  must first  define a  label at the point you want to go
        to. Labels are defined  as any  string of  less than  16 characters
        terminated by a colon (:).


        Syntax:
        ------

        GOTO label

        where 'label' is defined somewhere else in the program.


        Example:
        -------

        GOTO here

        will  transfer  control  to  the  line which begins with the string
        'here:'. There may only be one  label of  a particular  name in one
        GRASP program. 


        Comments:
        --------

        You may have up to 512 labels in a GRASP program.

        Summary:
        -------

        IFKEY allows  conditional branching by means of an implied goto. If
        the key indicated in  the  command  matches  the  last  key pressed
        during a waitkey command, branching occurs.


        Syntax:
        ------

        IFKEY key label

        where  key  is  the  key  code  to  compare to and label is a label
        defined elsewhere in the program.


        Example:
        -------

        IFKEY 1 part1

        means that if, during  the last  waitkey command,  the '1'  key was
        pressed, goto label "PART1".


        Comments:
        --------

        Valid keys are all numeric and letter keys, F1-F10, UP, DN, LF, RT,
        PGUP, PGDN, HOME, END.

        Summary:
        -------

        LINE allows you to draw a single pixel width line on the  screen in
        the current drawing color.


        Syntax:
        ------

        LINE startx, starty, endx, endy

        where 'startx'  and 'starty' is the location for the first point in
        the line and 'endx' and 'endy' is the  location for  the last point
        in the line.


        Example:
        -------

        LINE 0,0,100,100

        will draw  a line  in the  current drawing  color from  x=0, y=0 to
        x=100, y=100.


        Comments:
        --------

        Transparent  mode  does  not  affect  this  command.  LINE  is  not
        available in text modes.

        Summary:
        -------

        This command  is used  to link to another text command file. IF you
        wish to have several special  effects,  and  for  editing purposes,
        keep them  is separate  ASCII files, you may link them during GRASP
        run time with this command.


        Syntax:
        ------

        LINK txtfile

        where 'txtfile' is  the  name  of  the  command  file  you  wish to
        execute.  File  name  extensions  are  not  required,  but all text
        command files must have an extension of txt.


        Example:
        -------

        LINK race

        will  link  to  the  text  command  file  'race.txt'  and  continue
        executing.


        Comments:
        --------

        Since this  command requires  interpretation of the command itself,
        the loading of a  new file,  and the  interpretation of  the second
        file, it has a tendency to slow things down. It is recommended that
        all commands be put into  one  file  before  giving  a presentation
        using GRASP.  This command  is useful during development, or if you
        have stored several effects  from previous  demonstrations and want
        to link them together.

        Summary:
        -------

        This  command  causes  the  GRASP  interpreter  to loop back to the
        previous mark. This will happen n number of  times, where  n is the
        number specified in the previous MARK command.


        Syntax:
        ------

        LOOP


        Example:
        -------

        LOOP

        will loop to previous mark.


        Comments:
        --------

        MARK/LOOP pairs may be nested up to 16 levels deep.

        Summary:
        -------

        This command  is used to mark a position which will be the top of a
        loop. Coupled with the LOOP command, MARK allows you to  repeat the
        same steps in your GRASP command file a specified number of times.


        Syntax:
        ------

        MARK xxx

        where 'xxx'  is the  number of  times you wish to loop back to this
        mark.


        Example:
        -------

        MARK 10

        will place a mark at this  point  so  that  the  next  time  a LOOP
        command is  encountered, the  program will loop back to this point.
        This process will occur ten times.


        Comments:
        --------

        MARK/LOOP pairs may be  nested up  to 16  levels deep.  The maximum
        number of times you can loop is 65535.

        Summary:
        -------

        Mode is used in IBM CGA 4 color mode and IBM CGA 2 color mode only.
        It is used to set the palette and border color in these modes. 


        Syntax:
        ------

        MODE border color, palette

        where 'border color' refers to the  background color  in IBM  CGA 4
        color mode  and foreground  color in  IBM CGA 2 color mode. 'Border
        color' can be in  the range  0-15. Palette  affects only  IBM CGA 4
        color mode  and is  in the range 0-5. Refer to the following tables
        for specifics.

        Summary:
        -------

        NOISE allows you to make music in GRASP. By specifying starting and
        ending frequencies, as well as  a  duration,  you  can  make single
        notes, or complex sounds.


        Syntax:
        ------

        NOISE startfreq, endfreq, duration

        where 'startfreq'  and 'startfreq' are the starting frequencies for
        the noise and 'duration' is the overall length of the noise.


        Example:
        -------

        NOISE 440,440,100

        will play the note with a frequency 440 for duration 100.

        OFFSET                                                      OFFSET


        Summary:
        -------

        The  OFFSET  command  allows  you  to  treat  coordinates  in other
        commands  (like  putup,  line,  box,  cfade,  etc...)  as  relative
        coordinates rather than absolute. If the OFFSET is set to 0,0, then
        the coordinates you enter in the other commands are relative to the
        screen as a whole  which appears  to be  absolute. This  command is
        used when  you want to repeat a series of operations but don't want
        to have to alter all the  coordinates in  order to  use a different
        region of the screen.


        Syntax:
        ------

        OFFSET x,y

        where 'x' and 'y' are the x and y offset values.


        Example:
        -------

        OFFSET 40,32

        will set  the offset  to x=40, y=32. This means that if you specify
        that you want a line drawn from 0,0 to 10,10, it will actually draw
        it from 40,32 to 50,42. In other words, the offset values are added
        to the coordinate data you type in the command.

        PALETTE                                                    PALETTE


        Summary:
        -------

        Palette is used to set the current palette to that of the specified
        picture  which  has  been  loaded  into  a buffer. This sets the 16
        colors out of 64 on  EGA  16  color  modes  and  the border-palette
        combination of CGA 4 color mode.


        Syntax:
        ------

        PALETTE buffer number

        Where  'buffer  number'  is  the  number of the buffer in which the
        picture resides.


        Example:
        -------

        PALETTE 2

        will set the current palette to  the palette  used for  the picture
        which was loaded into buffer 2 with the PLOAD command.


        Comments:
        --------

        This command  was intended  for use  in EGA 16 color mode and CGA 4
        color  mode  only.  Use  in  other  modes  may  cause unpredictable
        results. Use with caution.

        PAN                                                           PAN


        Summary:
        -------

        This  command  allows  you  to  perform  a  hardware pan if you are
        operating in one of the EGA modes. If the picture  you want  to pan
        around on  is larger  than a screen then the following rules apply:
        1) You MUST use PFADE number 0 to put up  the picture,  2) when you
        are  finished  panning  and  scrolling, you MUST PFREE the picture,
        clear the screen with CLEARSCR, then do a RESETSCR before using any
        other pictures.  This is so that the EGA will be able to keep track
        of which picture you are using  and how  to best  display it. Also,
        sequences  of   PAN  commands  should  always  return  you  to  the
        coordinate 0,0 when you are done. Think of  the picture  as being a
        very large  screen with the upper left corner being coordinate 0,0.
        Pan  then  allows  you  to  change  upper  left  corner  to  be any
        coordinate in the valid coordinate space.


        Syntax:
        ------

        PAN x0,y0,x1,y1,buffer

        where 'x0',  'y0' is  the starting coordinate for panning and 'x1',
        'y1' is the ending coordinate. 'Buffer' is the  picture buffer that
        the command  will look into to get real picture coordinates and set
        the EGA display modes to coincide to.


        Example:
        -------

        PAN 0,0,100,100,1
        PAN 100,100,0,0,1

        will smoothly pan the screen diagonally from the  upper left corner
        to 100,100 and back again.


        Comments:
        --------

        This  is  a  complicated  command  and requires some thought to use
        effectively. Be careful.

        CAUTION: It is imperative that you free the oversize picture buffer
        BEFORE you perform the CLEARSCR and RESETSCR functions!

        PFADE                                                        PFADE

        Summary:
        -------

        Pfade is the heart of GRASP. It allows you to dissolve a picture to
        the screen. You may specify one of several dissolves, the speed for
        that dissolve, and a delay after the dissolve.


        Syntax:
        ------

        PFADE fade number, buffer number, speed, delay

        where 'fade  number' is  the number  of the  fade you  want to use,
        'buffer number' is the picture buffer number where  the picture you
        want to  fade has been loaded, 'speed' is the speed of the fade and
        'delay' is the time to wait after the  delay. Speed  can be  in the
        range 0-10000. Check Appendix B for a list of fades.


        Example:
        -------

        PFADE 12,1,500,1000

        will fade  the picture  in buffer  1 using fade 12 at speed 500 and
        then wait 1000. The delay  works  the  same  as  using  the WAITKEY
        command. 


        Comments:
        --------

        The first  25 fades in GRASP are the same in all video modes. Fades
        beyond 25 may be mode  specific  and  must  be  used  with caution.
        Specifying buffer  0 will  cause a  blank screen of current drawing
        color to  be generated  and faded  to the  screen. Transparent mode
        does NOT apply to PFADE.

        Summary:
        -------

        PFREE is  used to  free-up a picture buffer. Sometimes, you may run
        out of memory and need to clear up  some buffers  you have  full of
        pictures you have already used.


        Syntax:
        ------

        PFREE buf1, buf2, buf3...

        where 'buf1' and other buffers are buffers you want to free-up.


        Example:
        -------

        PFREE 1,2

        will free-up picture buffers 1 and 2.


        Comments:
        --------

        This  is  especially  useful  in  EGA  16 color mode where space is
        critical.

        PLOAD                                                        PLOAD


        Summary:
        -------

        This command is used to load a picture into a buffer. There are  16
        buffers available  for pictures in GRASP. It is advised, for memory
        reasons, that the user try  to  manage  using  only  one  buffer. A
        picture must  be loaded  into a  buffer before  it can be dissolved
        onto the screen.


        Syntax:
        ------

        PLOAD picture,buffer number

        where 'picture' is the name of  the picture  you want  to load (the
        file name  extension is optional) and 'buffer number' is the number
        of the buffer you want to load in  to. Valid  buffer numbers  are 1
        through 16.  Buffer 0  is a dummy buffer used for solid color wipes
        and changes, and thus, no picture may be loaded into it.


        Example:
        -------

        PLOAD mypic,1

        will load the picture myfile.pic into picture buffer number 1.

        POINT                                                        POINT


        Summary:
        -------

        POINT allows you to draw  a  single  pixel  on  the  screen  in the
        current drawing  color. If  a second  point is  indicated, a random
        point  is  drawn  in  the  rectangular  region  defined  by  the  4
        coordinates.


        Syntax:
        ------

        POINT startx, starty, <endx, endy>

        where  'startx'  and  'starty'  is  the  location for the point and
        'endx' and 'endy' define the region for randomization.


        Example:
        -------

        POINT 50,50

        will draw a point in the current drawing color at x=50, y=50.

        POINT 100,100,150,150

        will draw a random point in the region defined by 100,100,150,150.


        Comments:
        --------
         
        Transparent mode does not affect this command.

        PUTUP                                                        PUTUP


        Summary:
        -------

        PUTUP allows you to  place  a  clipping  on  the  screen.  PUTUP is
        similar to  CFADE 0,  but allows  placement at any x and y location
        and supports transparent mode.


        Syntax:
        ------

        PUTUP x ,y, <buffer number>, <delay>

        where 'x' and 'y' are the location where  the lower  left corner of
        the clipping will be placed, 'buffer number' is the clipping buffer
        number where the clipping you want to put  up resides  and delay is
        the time to wait after the putup in hundredths of a second.


        Example:
        -------

        PUTUP 25,50,1,1000

        will put  the clipping  in buffer  1 up on the screen at x=25, y=50
        and then wait for time 1000 (10 seconds). Remember that the x and y
        coordinates correspond  to the  current video mode. Exceeding these
        coordinates may result in an error message.

        RESETSCR                                                   RESETSCR


        Summary:
        -------

        This command is used to reset  the virtual  screen back  to display
        screen size after a PAN command with a larger-than-screen picture.


        Syntax:
        ------

        RESETSCR


        Example:
        -------

        RESETSCR 

        will reset the virtual screen image.


        Comments:
        --------

        Works only with EGA modes and PAN command.

        RETURN                                                       RETURN


        Summary:
        -------

        This command  causes execution  of the  current sub-program to halt
        and return control to the calling program.


        Syntax:
        ------

        RETURN


        Example:
        -------

        RETURN

        will return control to calling program.

        SETCOLOR                                                  SETCOLOR


        Summary:
        -------

        Setcolor is used to set the color palette  registers in  IBM EGA 16
        color modes.  On the  EGA, there  are 16 possible colors, called an
        'index', and each of  these color  indices may  be one  of 64 color
        'values'. SETCOLOR  differs from CHGCOLOR in that SETCOLOR sets all
        16 color  indices  at  once.  This  is  faster  and  is  useful for
        animation effects.


        Syntax:
        ------

        SETCOLOR color value 1, color value 2, ... color value 16

        where 'color value n' lies in the range 0-63.


        Example:
        -------

        SETCOLOR 3,32,23,53,12,11,10,21,35,2,4,8,30,40,61,63

        will  set  the  current  palette  registers  to the 16 color values
        specified.


        Comments:
        --------

        Remember, this only works  in EGA  16 color  modes and  requires an
        Enhanced Color Display (ECD).

        Summary:
        -------

        TEXT allows  you to put-up a string of text in the font loaded with
        FLOAD in the current drawing color.


        Syntax:
        ------

        TEXT x, y, string, <delay>

        where 'x' and 'y' is the location of the lower  left corner  of the
        first character in the string, 'string' is the string to put up and
        'delay' is the time  to wait  after the  put-up in  hundredths of a
        second.


        Example:
        -------

        TEXT 4,4,"This is a text string..."

        will put  the string  indicated between  the quotes up at x=4, y=4,
        using the current drawing color.


        Comments:
        --------

        The string to be put must be in double quotes.

        Summary:
        -------

        TRAN allows you to set transparent mode on  or off,  and to specify
        which  colors  to  make  transparent.  This  is used for overlaying
        objects or floating objects across complex backgrounds.


        Syntax:
        ------

        TRAN on/off, color1, color2,...colorn

        where 'on/off' specifies whether  you want  transparent mode turned
        on or  off and color1-colorn indicate which colors you want to make
        transparent. Color1-colorn may have the values 0 to  maxcolor where
        maxcolor  is  the  highest  color  number available in your current
        video mode.


        Example:
        -------

        TRAN on 2,14

        will turn  transparent  mode  on  and  make  the  colors  2  and 14
        transparent.

        TRAN off

        will turn transparent mode off.


        Comments:
        --------

        If you  turn transparent mode on and off, the next time you turn it
        on, you must re-specify  which colors  you want  to be transparent.
        Transparent does not work in EGA 16 color modes.

        Summary:
        -------

        Video is  used to  set the video mode. Video should be used  at the
        beginning of the  GRASP  text  file.  Video  modes  may  be changed
        during   the  demo, but caution is advised. Damage may be done to a

        These modes,  (with the  exception of the text modes) correspond to
        PCPAINT video modes.


        Example:
        -------

        VIDEO G

        Will set up GRASP to  use  the  high  resolution  mode  of  the EGA
        adapter in 16 out of 64 colors.

        Comments:
        --------

        Memory requirement in the table above is the approximate amount  of
        memory required for the buffer to hold EACH picture you load in for
        use. Also,  pay attention  to the  size of the screen in each video
        mode. Attempting to FADE  pictures other  that this  size may yield
        unpredictable results.  The exception to this is when using the PAN
        command on an EGA.

        WAITKEY                                                    WAITKEY


        Summary:
        -------

        This command instructs the  demonstration or  presentation to pause
        until a  key is  pressed, or  until timeout value, if specified. If
        timeout occurs, conditional branching is allowed.


        Syntax:
        ------

        WAITKEY <timeout>, <label>

        where 'timeout' is the time to wait before  timeout in  100ths of a
        second and 'label' is the label to go to if timeout occurs.


        Example:
        -------

        WAITKEY 600,myline

        will wait  until a  key is pressed, or until delay of 6 seconds. If
        delay of 6 seconds is reached, goto label 'myline'.


        Comments:
        --------

        If no timeout is specified, WAITKEY will wait  forever until  a key
        is pressed.  The key that is pressed to abort the wait is saved and
        may be tested by IFKEY.

        WINDOW                                                       WINDOW


        Summary:
        -------

        This command is used  to restrict  a picture  fade to  a particular
        portion of  the screen. The coordinates you pass are in pixels, but
        they are rounded to the nearest byte, or usually 8 pixels.


        Syntax:
        ------

        WINDOW x,y,x1,y1

        where 'x', 'y', 'x1' and 'y1'  are the  lower left  and upper right
        corner of the window to set for clipping.


        Example:
        -------

        WINDOW 40,40,100,160

        will set  the fade  window to 40,40,100,160. The PFADE command will
        only fade that portion of the screen that lies in this region.


        Comments:
        --------

        WINDOW has no effect on the CFADE command.

        A simple slideshow can be constructed  by creating  a grasp command
        file as follows:


        ; Slideshow demo for GRASP
        ;
        ; This program will load and display 4 pictures, alternating
        ; between fade #1 and fade #2, waiting for a count of 500 between
        ; each fade.
        ;
         video a             ; set medium res 4 color CGA mode (this can
                             ; be whatever mode you want to use)
        ;
         load pic1           ; load pic1 into buffer 1
         fade 1              ; fade using fade number 1
         waitkey 500         ; wait for a count of 500
        ;
         load pic2           ; load pic2 into buffer 1
         fade 2              ; but use fade #2 this time.
         waitkey 500         ; etc...
        ;
         load pic3
         fade 1
         waitkey 500
        ;
         load pic4
         fade 2
         waitkey 500
        ;
         exit                ; quit the program

        Example Program #2 - How to animate using FLY
        ---------------------------------------------

        Let's say  you have  2 clippings  which are  a flock  of birds with
        wings up and wings down. To fly them across the screen, (from 0,160
        to 300,160 issue the following sequence:


         tran on 3      ; turn transparent mode on
                        ; (this assumes the background is color 3.)
        ;
         cload birds1,1                ; load in first clip
         cload birds2,2                ; load in second clip
         fly 0,160,300,160,3,4,1,2     ; fly 'em!
        ;
         tran off       ; turn off transparent mode

        The parameters  in the  fly command  are x1,y1,x2,y2,step(number of
        pixels between each putup),delay(time of delay between each putup),
        and list of clippings, in this case, 1 and 2.

        APPENDIX C - Error Messages

        The following is a  list of  messages you  may get  while executing
        GRASP and some of their causes and solutions.


        MOST COMMON ERRORS:


        I.    The  most  common  error  is  not a grasp program error but a
              system error. The screen will  clear,  and  you  will  get an
              error like

         External Memory allocation overflow, xxxxk requested, yyyyk free.

              This means  that you have tried to load a picture or clipping
              that is too large  for the  memory you  have left.  There are
              several fixes for this problem.
              1) Buy more memory. EGA 16 color demos usually take most of a
              640K machine
              2) Check your code and use PFREE, CFREE and FFREE to clean up
              memory  when  you  are  through  using  particular  pictures,
              clippings and fonts. See the section  of the  manual on these
              commands.
              3)  Use  the  special  parameter, ',1' on clipping loads that
              don't make the shifted copies. In order to be able to PUTUP a
              clipping at  any single-pixel coordinate, GRASP needs to make
              up to 8 shifted copies of the clipping.  If you  are going to
              be using  CFADE or putting it up at a byte boundary, then the
              shifted copies aren't necessary. You can keep them from being
              generated by typing:

              CLOAD clip,1,1 ;note the extra ',1'

              If you  do specify the extra parameter, and you try to put up
              the clipping at a non-byte  boundary,  no  putup  will occur.
              Remember,  FLY,  FLOAT  and  PUTUP  can  put clippings at any
              coordinate. CFADE can only putup at a byte boundary.

              If none of the above three  work,  then  call  the  GRASP and
              PCPAINT BBS for more advice.

        II. System Errors

         The following  is a  list of  the GRASP system errors that you may
        encounter. These will appear on the top of the screen while running
        your demo  along with  a line number where the error occurred. When
        you press a key, you will be returned to that line in your program.
        If you  get the  error while running under the runtime version, the
        program will stop.



        DUPLICATE LABEL 

        - You have used the same label name more than once in your demo and
        GRASP is confused.


        ERROR IN LOOP COUNT

         - Loop count  must be  a positive  number. This  error occurs if a
        negative number was specified.


        ERROR IN NAME

         - You have used an invalid character  in a  filename, or  the file
        GRASP was trying to load was not found.


        ERROR IN PACKED CLIPPING

         - sometimes,  clippings  may  be  trashed or someone tries to load
        some other file with a .CLP extension. If GRASP does  not recognize
        a  clipping  as  being  a  valid  clipping  file, you will get this
        message.


        ERROR IN XCOORD

         - The Y-coordinate lies off  the screen.  This may  occur after an
        OFFSET command. If you specify 0 for the Y coordinate, but Y offset
        is set to -5, you will get this error.


        ERROR IN YCOORD

         - The Y-coordinate lies off  the screen.  This may  occur after an
        OFFSET command. If you specify 0 for the Y coordinate, but Y offset
        is set to -5, you will get this error.

        ERROR LOADING FONT

         - GRASP doesn't recognize the  font you  are trying  to load. Also
        could be too large for memory or hardware error during load.


        ERROR LOADING PICTURE

         - GRASP doesn't recognize the picture you are trying to load. Also
        could be hardware error during load.


        ERROR LOADING TEXT

         - GRASP doesn't recognize the text file you are trying to link to.
        Also could be hardware during load.


        ILLEGAL ARGUMENT(S)

         - One  of  the  arguments  for  the  current  command  is invalid.
        Examples are invalid video mode, etc.


        ILLEGAL BUFFER

         - You have specified a buffer  number  that  is  outside  of valid
        range. Buffers  are 1-16 for pictures and 1-128 for clippings. Also
        may get this when an error occurs trying  to allocate  a new buffer
        during load.


        ILLEGAL COLOR

         - You have specified an invalid color number for this video mode.


        ILLEGAL FADE

         - You have specified an invalid fade number. Valid fades are 0-25.


        ILLEGAL PALETTE

         - You have  specified an  invalid palette  number for  CGA 4 color
        mode. Valid palettes are 0-5.


        ILLEGAL SPEED

         - You have specified an invalid speed for a fade. Valid speeds are
        0-10000.

                                   Page:  77






        INVALID FONT STYLE

         - You have  specified an  invalid font  style number. Valid styles
        are 0-6.


        INVALID GAP VALUE

         - You have specified an invalid GAP value. Range is 0-255.


        LABEL NOT FOUND

         - You have  tried to  reference a  label which  was not previously
        defined.


        MEMORY ERROR

         - When trying  to allocate the memory for your GRASP command file,
        an error was encountered. Usually only happens when  a command file
        is too large.


        NOT ENOUGH ARGUMENTS

         - Certain commands require a minimum number of arguments. You need
        to specify some more.


        THIS COMMAND REQUIRES AN EGA

         - Just like it says, this particular command requires  an EGA card
        and EGA video mode to operate.


        TOO MANY LOOPS

         - You have nested your loops deeper than the maximum, which is 16,
        or you have more loop commands that mark commands.


        TOO MANY MARKS

         - You have nested your loops deeper than the maximum, which is 16,
        or you have more mark commands than loop commands.


        UNKNOWN COMMAND

         - GRASP found  something that  was not  a comment, not a label and
        couldn't recognize as a valid command. Check your spelling.

        APPENDIX D - Picture Swap Line


        There is a public domain electronic  bulletin board  which operates
        24 hours a day with the sole purpose of providing a method by which
        users of PCPAINT and GRASP may exchange pictures, clippings, fonts,
        effects and  ideas. This help eliminate the extra cost of providing
        artwork for many of  the GRASP  demos you  may want  to create. The
        most current version of GRASP will be avaliable this system.

        All uploads  and downloads  are free  and may be used by anyone. We
        encourage you to contribute any artwork you feel  could be  used by
        someone  else.  Of  course  there  will  be proprietary artwork you
        either pay  to have  developed, or  need to  keep confidential. But
        your discards may be another's joy...

        The BBS is located in Costa Mesa, California, and the number is

                           ***    (714) 545-8100    ***

        You will  be limited  to 1 hour of use per day. We suggest that you
        use 1200 or 2400 baud modems set at 8 bits, 1 stop  bit, no parity.
        You will  be transferring binary files so the 8 bit mode is a must.
        There are several utility programs you will want  to download first
        which allow you to squeeze and unsqueeze the pic files so that they
        will not take as much time  to upload  and download.  You will find
        them in the UTILITY file area.


        Thanks in advance for your support and contributions to the board.
