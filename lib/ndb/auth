#         Data Base
#           An ndb(2) database file exists for the authentication
#           server.  The attribute types used by the AS are hostid and
#           uid.  The value in the hostid is a client host's ID.  The
#           values in the uid pairs in the same entry list which users
#           that host ID make speak for.  A uid value of * means the
#           host ID may speak for all users.  A uid value of !user means
#           the host ID may not speak for user.  For example:
#           hostid=bootes
#                uid=!sys uid=!adm uid=*
