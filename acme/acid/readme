Capital A Acid is a rudimentary acme interface to the debugger acid.
It uses a win to provide an interactive window for acid.  In that window,
a couple of extra acme-specific features are enabled:

w(command)
	runs the command and places its output in a new window.
	e.g. w(lstk()) places the stack trace in a distinct window.

Also, in any such window, text executed with button 2 is
presented as input to acid in the main Acid window.  Thus, for
example, one may evaluate variables presented in a stack trace
by `executing' it with button 2.
