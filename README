This is Plan 9 for amd64 built with gcc (and soon, I hope, clang).

This file is a quick list of instructions to get you started quickly.

Prerequisites
=============

To build harvey and play with it, you need to have git, golang, qemu, gcc,
binutils and bison installed. On a Debian, Ubuntu or other .deb system,
you should be able to get going with

	sudo aptitude install git golang build-essential bison qemu-system

GERRIT
======

We use gerrithub.io for code-review. If you want to submit changes, go to

	https://review.gerrithub.io/#/admin/projects/elbing/harvey

and check out the repository from gerrithub rather than github. The clone
command will probably look something like this:

	git clone ssh://USERNAME@review.gerrithub.io:29418/elbing/harvey

you'll need to run a few commands inside the top-level directory to get set
up for code-review:

	cd harvey
	curl -Lo .git/hooks/commit-msg
	http://review.gerrithub.io/tools/hooks/commit-msg
	chmod u+x .git/hooks/commit-msg
	git config remote.origin.push HEAD:refs/for/master

You're now all set, you can build the whole thing just by running

	./BUILD all

which should take maybe a minute.

Once building is complete, you can try booting the kernel with qemu

	(cd sys/src/9/k10 && sh ../../../../util/QRUN)

Next you should find a bug somewhere in harvey and fix it. In general, the
util/build tool "just works" in any subdirectory, so you can also build just
the stuff you are looking at, too, eg.

	cd sys/src/cmd/aux
	build aux.json

Let's say you found a bug and the files you needed to change were
sys/src/9/ip/tcp.c and sys/src/9/ip/ipaux.c. To submit this for review, you do

	git add sys/src/9/ip/tcp.c
	git add sys/src/9/ip/ipaux.c
	git diff --staged # to check that the patch still makes sense
	git commit -m 'your description of the patch'
	git push

Note the lack of qualifiers in the last push command. It is important,
because it needs to be pushed to "origin HEAD:refs/for/master" for review
(and not to master). This will generate a code-review change request, others
will review it, and if it looks good we will merge it to the mainline repo
using gerrithub.io.

If your patch needs further work (you notice something wrong with it yourself,
or someone suggests changes), you can just edit the affected files and then
amend the change list as follows

	git add sys/src/9/ip/tcp.c
	git commit --amend
	git push

More information on using Gerrit can be found on the gerrithub.io website.
