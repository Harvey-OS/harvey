There are two ways to run the auth server.

One, if you have Plan 9 Port installed, you can simply use listen1:

	sudo /usr/local/plan9/bin/listen1 tcp!*!567 chroot util/auth /bin/authsrv9

(run that command from the harvey root)

The second option is to add it to /etc/inetd.conf:

	567	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/chroot	chroot /path/to/harvey/util/auth /bin/authsrv9

Once you've saved the file, do "pkill -HUP inetd" to restart it.
