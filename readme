This is a re-release of the 1st Edition of Plan 9 from Bell Labs.

1st Edition was originally released by AT&T in 1992 under a
proprietary agreement only available to a small number of universities
and not for publication.

This represents a very early version of the system, but most of what
makes it Plan 9 is already visible. The original release notes for
this edition can be found at /sys/doc/release.ms.

Given its age, this release is mostly for educational and research
purposes, although given the inclination and appropriate hardware we
believe you should be able to run it. Note, however, that the 9p
protocol and authentication mechanism have changed between this
release and modern Plan 9, so interoperability might be tricky.

The only changes between this release and the original 1st Edition
release are the notice, license, and readme files, and moving the
original notice file. In particular, any copyright notices attributing
things to AT&T or Bell Labs, or notices on restrictions of their use,
should be read as historical; all such rights have been transferred to
the Plan 9 Foundation and released as open source. Parts (notably, the
fonts) maintain trademark and copyright to their respective parties
(such as Bigelow & Holmes Inc.) and were included in Plan 9 by
permission; those copyrights are unaffected by the transfer to Plan 9
Foundation and remain in effect per the terms found in this
distribution.
